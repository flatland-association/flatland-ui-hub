# Documentation index

**This file is the single index of all docs.** Every markdown file under `docs/`
is listed here; if you add one, add its line here too. `reference/OVERVIEW.md`
is the narrative entry point (what the app is, how to try it, roadmap) and links
back here for the full list.

Docs are grouped by purpose. Start with **reference/** for the living truth.

## Product

- [product-vision.md](product-vision.md) — mirror of the [wiki Product Vision](https://github.com/flatland-association/flatland-ui-hub/wiki/Product-Vision) (authoritative there), plus a detailed MVP proposal and an inventory of what exists today

## reference/ — living reference
The authoritative specs and guides for how the app works today.
