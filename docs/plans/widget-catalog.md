# Widget catalog — candidates, sources, effort, contribution

> **This doc is the backlog narrative** (sources, effort, contribution). The
> machine-readable counterpart — kind, granularity, status, per-mode behaviour,
> grounding, availability for every widget (built *and* planned) — lives in
> [`core/widgets/widget-catalog.ts`](../../frontend/src/app/core/widgets/widget-catalog.ts)
> and renders in the in-app **Widget Gallery** (`/widgets`). Keep the two in sync;
> author new widgets with the [`/create-widget`](../../.claude/skills/create-widget/SKILL.md) skill.
>
> Working collection of candidate widgets, classified per
> [interaction-framework.md](../reference/interaction-framework.md). Each entry:
> **source(s)**, `kind`, **effort** (Claude-Code tokens ≈ working sessions, and
> calendar days incl. review), **what must change**, and **contribution to our
> core questions**. Ranked within groups by contribution-to-effort.
>
> Sources: **[D3.1]** AI4REALNET solutions deliverable · **[D3.2]** beta software
> (A3S/TraceRL, T3.2 Pareto, INESC UQ, FHNW MARL) · **[UIX]**
> [ui-exploration-synthesis](../reference/ui-exploration-synthesis.md) (cross-model
> convergence) · **[DB]** owner's research line (accountability / trust /
> allocation).

> **Q3** accountability measurement · **Q4** allocation / Human-in-Control seam ·
> **Q5** study value (User Study 2 instruments).

Effort scale: **S** ≈ ≤150k tokens / ≤1 day · **M** ≈ 150–400k / 1–3 days ·
**L** ≈ >400k / 3–5+ days (backend + frontend + tests).

## A. Trust & accountability (owner's centre of gravity)

### A1. Risk & Uncertainty indicator ("honest uncertainty") — [D3.1]+[D3.2]+[UIX]+[DB]
`kind` **Trust** · overview→detail. Per recommendation/option: reliability
indicator + uncertainty interval; detail view separates *why uncertain* (data vs
model — epistemic/aleatoric per INESC framework as far as backend allows).
- **Status:** **first cut built** — `risk-uncertainty-panel.component.ts`,
  frontend-only, registered at the seams (plugin-host, palette, matrix). Not
  calibrated; label reads "model-reported confidence" until the UQ/calibration
  backend extension lands. See [widget-a1-risk-uncertainty.md](widget-a1-risk-uncertainty.md).
- **Effort:** M. **Change:** frontend widget + backend proxy first (scenario-KPI
  spread, forecast variance across rollouts = cheap ensemble); true epistemic/
  aleatoric = later backend extension (flagged, not faked).
- **Contributes:** Q2 (core), Q1 (framing per mode), Q5 (overtrust proxy data).
  Direct D3.1 family #1; UIX top-bet "consequence-first card + honest uncertainty".

### A2. Decision log & accountability strip — [DB]+[D3.1]
`kind` **Capitalization** · detail. Decisions as owned events
(`accountableOwner`, lifecycle), rendered as a session strip: who decided what,
when, response time, override vs accept; JSON export.
- **Status:** **first cut built** — `features/decision-log/` component + a
  `decisionLog` signal in `SessionStore` fed by the existing choke-points
  (`setOverride` / `clearOverride` / `systemHold`) in all three modes, tagged
  `accountableOwner: human | ai | system`. `coLearningFeedback` (Co-Learning
  only) left untouched. JSON export + override-rate / mean-decision-time
  readout. Registered at the seams (plugin-host, palette, matrix). See
  [widget-a2-decision-log.md](widget-a2-decision-log.md).
- **Effort:** M (rides on [interaction-logging-plan](interaction-logging-plan.md)
  — realises its first slice). **Change:** frontend store already sees decisions
  (`setOverride`, applyOption, auto-decide); add an event record + widget; backend
  optional at first.
- **Contributes:** Q3 (core — override rate, friction asymmetry, decision-time ÷
  acceptance), Q5 (the study instrument), Q4 (owner comes from `allocation`).
- **AI4REALNET check — confirmed WP4 validation-KPI alignment:**
  [`ai4realnet-orchestrators`](https://github.com/AI4REALNET/ai4realnet-orchestrators)
  (the WP4 Validation Campaign Hub / "FAB" integration) has a Railway module
  with a named human-factors KPI catalog (HS-003 intervention frequency,
  AS-005 agreement score, HS-023 response time, RS-091..096 reflection on
  trust/agency/de-skilling/over-reliance/biases) that overlaps almost
  one-to-one with this widget's fields — no code to reuse (those KPIs are
  uncoded, collected via survey/interactive-loop), but the schema should be
  named to map onto these IDs later without a rename. See widget-a2 spec §5b.

### A3. AI track record / reliability history — [DB]+[D3.1]
`kind` **Trust** · overview. Rolling record: how often were AI suggestions
taken / overridden, and how did followed vs overridden decisions turn out
(delay delta). The calibration mirror for the operator.
- **Effort:** M–L (needs outcome attribution per decision → depends on A2).
- **Contributes:** Q2 (appropriate reliance, Weyer-vs-Grote tension made
  visible), Q3, Q5.
- **AI4REALNET check:** two alternative/complementary UQ approaches to A1's
  evidential-NN target, both power-grid domain (semantic alignment, not
  drop-in) —
  [`RL-agent-uncertainty-prediction-module`](https://github.com/AI4REALNET/RL-agent-uncertainty-prediction-module)
  (Conformal Prediction — distribution-free intervals, arguably simpler than
  evidential NN) and
  [`failure_prediction`](https://github.com/AI4REALNET/failure_prediction)
  (D2.2, classical RF/XGBoost/LightGBM failure-prediction models — the
  "calibration data" reuse candidate for this widget's follow-up-outcome need).

## B. Prediction & what-if (A3S/TraceRL line)

### B1. What-if compare ("My solution vs. AI") — [D3.2]+[D3.1]+[UIX] — **FIRST CUT (built)**
`kind` **Prediction** · detail · type `whatif-compare`. **Built** — see
`docs/plans/widget-b1-whatif-compare.md` + `whatif-compare.component.ts`. Take a
decision point, branch: AI plan vs operator action, simulate both forward
(reuses the existing `whatIfOverride` endpoint — `baseline` = AI course,
`branch` = human), compare side-by-side with KPI deltas. Convention:
**human-influenced steps blue, AI-simulated yellow** (consortium/TraceRL, tokens
`--app-whatif-human/-ai`). Mode-aware: Commit in Rec/Co-L, read-only in Director.
This cut compares **KPI outcomes**, not drawn per-cell paths (flagged extension);
and reuses the in-repo forward-sim, not the real A3S Redis service (same
endpoint contract, swappable). A3S endpoints Restore / Action-space / Simulate ≈
our session + overrides + what-if APIs — mostly there.
- **Effort:** M. **Change:** frontend widget (branch view + compare); backend
  mostly exists, maybe a "simulate N steps from current state with overrides"
  convenience endpoint.
- **Contributes:** Q1 (Co-Learning dual-path §3.3!), Q2 (simulation-backed
  interpretability instead of static XAI), Q4 (A3S pattern), Q5.
- **AI4REALNET check — confirmed, exact reuse target:**
  [`agent-as-a-service-trace-rl`](https://github.com/AI4REALNET/agent-as-a-service-trace-rl)
  is A3S itself (Task 3.1 + Task 2.3), and it already has a **Flatland** config
  (`agent-as-a-service/conf/env/flatland/flatland.yaml`). Two parts:
  `agent-as-a-service` (Redis-backed: restore / simulate-forward / report action
  spaces) and `trace-rl` (Dash app rendering the episode as a **branching tree**
  of decision blocks, override → alternative future). Per CLAUDE.md's "reuse,
  don't reinvent" rule: this is the target, not a from-scratch what-if engine —
  the "convenience endpoint" above should wrap/mirror this rather than diverge
  from its restore/simulate/action-space vocabulary.

### B2. Conflict-aware Marey (ribbons + predicted lines) — [UIX 6/6]
> **Absorbed into B4 "Zug-Weg-Diagramm" (2026-09-23, first-cut).** Conflict
> ribbons ship there, on the station axis; this entry is kept for history and no
> longer has its own card in `widget-catalog.ts`. Spec:
> [`widget-b4-zug-weg-diagramm.md`](widget-b4-zug-weg-diagramm.md).

`kind` **Prediction/Context** · overview→detail. Marey with conflict ribbons,
predicted trajectories, plan-vs-actual. Strongest cross-model UIX bet; central
to §3.3 (see marey-rethink note).
- **Effort:** L (graphic-timetable is complex; prediction overlay needs care).
- **Contributes:** Q1 (Co-Learning), Q5; less directly Q2/Q3.
- **AI4REALNET check:** no direct match found (org repos are algorithm/HMI-shell
  focused, not timetable-visualisation specific). `T3.3-3.4-HMI` (PyQt) may still
  be worth a glance for how it renders the Flatland network/schedule, but it is
  not a Marey-style time-distance view — this stays a from-scratch UI build.

### B5. Netz-Zeitansicht (Network Time View) — [DB]+control-room practice
`kind` **Prediction** · overview→detail · type `network-time-view`. Rows are the
network's **contended resources** (platform tracks, single-track sections,
approaches), x is time, bars are occupancy; the running plan and a previewed one
are shown together, so an objective change reads as bars moving and a capacity
band disappearing.
- **Status:** spec written, not built —
  [widget-b5-network-time-view.md](widget-b5-network-time-view.md).
- **Why it is not B2 or B4:** both put *distance along a line* on the y-axis, so
  they presume a line exists. True for the PF–CH corridor, a fiction for Olten
  (60×35, 518 track cells, 52 trains, no corridor). Rows of resources need no
  geometry, so the same view serves both — and its height is set by the
  infrastructure, not the traffic.
- **Effort:** L, decomposing into view (M) + resource registry as Netz metadata
  (S–M) + occupancy derivation (M).
- **Cheap finding in the spec:** the row set can largely be *derived* — Olten's
  52 agents carry 24 distinct waypoint cells, which are exactly the
  infrastructure the timetable cares about. Only capacities and the sections
  nobody calls at have to be declared.
- **Contributes:** Q1 (Director gets a supervision instrument of its own), Q2
  (the cost of the AI's plan is shown, not asserted).
- **Grounding:** railway Belegungs-/Sperrzeitendarstellung (blocking-time theory,
  UIC 406) at resource granularity — control-room practice, not an invented form.

## C. Decision support (Evaluative AI)

### B3. Network correlation graph — [DB]
`kind` **Context** · overview→detail. Force-directed graph of trains/stations
(nodes = circles, severity-coloured, sized on focus) connected by
correlation-strength edges — a relational abstraction of the network
alongside the geographic Track Layout map, so "what else does this touch?" is
answered by proximity/edge-weight instead of scanning the map.
- **Effort:** M. **Change:** frontend only to start (KPI-delta correlation
  proxy, same "cheap proxy before real backend" move as A1); new D3
  dependency (`d3-force`/`d3-selection`/`d3-drag`/`d3-zoom` subset).
- **Contributes:** Q1 (Context widget behaves differently per mode's focus
  logic), situational awareness beyond the geographic map; a testable Q5
  comparison (does the graph surface correlated-but-distant trains the map
  misses?).
- **AI4REALNET check — confirmed, exact reuse target:**
  [`AI4REALNET/InteractiveAI`](https://github.com/AI4REALNET/InteractiveAI) —
  the consortium's own multi-use-case HMI (PowerGrid **and Railway** share one
  frontend). Its `frontend/src/components/organisms/Graph.vue` +
  `stores/components/graph.ts` is a D3 force-directed graph with exactly this
  pattern: severity-coloured circle nodes (`criticality` classes
  `LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH`), correlation-weighted edges, focus/zoom/tooltip on
  click — and its `Map.vue` uses the same `criticalityToColor` helper for
  `LCircleMarker` status dots, i.e. the consortium already treats "severity as
  a coloured circle" as a shared idiom across their graph *and* map views. See
  [widget-b3-network-correlation-graph.md](widget-b3-network-correlation-graph.md).
  Domain note: their hex-hardcoded CSS vars (`--red-500: #f55`, …) must **not**
  be ported — reimplement with our Lyne/`visual-encoding.ts` token seam.

### C1. Trade-off frontier / scenario small-multiples — [D3.2 T3.2]+[UIX 6/6]+[D3.1]
`kind` **Decision Support (Assessment)** · overview. Scenario alternatives
plotted over 2 KPI axes (Pareto-style), small-multiple previews; operator picks
by situational priority instead of trusting one ranked list. T3.2's "ensemble of
policies = Pareto front" is exactly this; scenario-panel already computes
per-scenario KPIs.
- **Effort:** M. **Change:** frontend only to start (existing scenario KPI
  deltas); true multi-policy Pareto = backend/policy extension later.
- **Contributes:** Q1 (Assessment framing = Co-Learning; ranked = Recommendation
  — the mode switch made visible in one widget), Q2 (trade-off transparency), Q5.
- **AI4REALNET check — strong match for the Assessment framing itself:**
  [`T2.3_explaining_action_alternatives`](https://github.com/AI4REALNET/T2.3_explaining_action_alternatives)
  (D2.3) generates accurate *expected-outcome* explanations per action
  alternative without assuming the operator's reward weights — this is the
  concrete grounding for "evidence for/against options" (better than citing
  Miller alone; see `interaction-framework.md` §2). For the Pareto/multi-policy
  half:
  [`Grid2Op_MORL`](https://github.com/AI4REALNET/Grid2Op_MORL) confirms a real
  multi-objective-RL/Pareto implementation exists (power-grid domain, semantic
  alignment only). Also see
  [`KPIs-cards`](https://github.com/AI4REALNET/KPIs-cards) (WP4) for the
  consortium's own filterable KPI-card convention — worth aligning small-multiple
  styling with.

### C2. Triage'd event feed (act-now sorting, lead-time bars) — [UIX 6/6]
`kind` **Event** · overview. Notifications sorted by required action time, not
chronology; lead-time bars; grouping (EEMUA 191 alarm practice).
- **Effort:** S–M (notifications-panel refactor + eta data mostly present).
- **Contributes:** Q5, situation awareness; indirectly Q3 (what did the operator
  see when deciding).
- **AI4REALNET check:** no direct match found; EEMUA 191 is external
  control-room practice, not a consortium artefact. Stays a from-scratch build.

## D. Allocation & autonomy (seams made visible)

### D1. Autonomy dial / allocation panel — [D3.2 A3S #3]+[D3.1]+[DB]
`kind` **Control** · overview. Shows current `allocation` ({loop stage →
human/ai/shared}) as a visible panel; in Director, a dial from
autonomous-recommendation → supervised → override-only → simulation-only.
First step: **display only** (derived from mode) — already valuable as the
"who owns what right now" mirror; runtime adjustment later (seam §5a).
- **Effort:** S (display) → L (true runtime reallocation).
- **Contributes:** Q4 (core), Q3 (control-before-responsibility made visible),
  Q1.
- **AI4REALNET check — direct matches for the runtime-reallocation half:**
  [`Tokener`](https://github.com/AI4REALNET/Tokener) (Hybrid: CBS+PP,
  token-based interaction — matches "who owns what right now" made explicit
  via tokens) and
  [`T3.4-with-HMI`](https://github.com/AI4REALNET/T3.4-with-HMI) (PPO
  controller + HMI that **injects high-level decisions at runtime while the
  controller stays the base decision layer** — literally the display-then-dial
  progression this widget plans). Skim
  [`T3.3-3.4-HMI`](https://github.com/AI4REALNET/T3.3-3.4-HMI)'s
  `HMI_overview.png` for how they render the allocation/mode state before
  designing this widget's UI from scratch.

### D2. Partial Non-Control zones — [DB]
`kind` **Trust/Context** · detail. Explicitly mark what the operator *cannot*
influence right now (e.g. malfunction duration, other trains under AI control)
— honest boundary per Grote, precondition for fair accountability.
- **Effort:** S–M (mostly framing/presentation of existing state).
- **Contributes:** Q3 (novel, owner's research contribution), Q2.
- **AI4REALNET check:** no match found — this is the owner's own research
  contribution (Grote's Partial Non-Control), not in any consortium deliverable
  found. Stays a from-scratch build, deliberately.

## E. Coordinated multi-train actions

### E1. Combined Actions (multi-train packages, human-reorderable) — [UIX]+[D3.4]+[D2.3] — **FIRST CUT (built)**
`kind` **Decision Support** · overview-detail · `dataSource` **mock**. Three
AI-proposed *coordinated* actions — each an ordered train priority list over the
trains contending for one resource — with the predicted impact, affected-train
count and confidence per package. The dispatcher reorders the chips in place
(drag-and-drop, or `←`/`→` on a focused chip); the sequence updates immediately
and the prediction is recalculated behind a short "Updating prediction…" state.
The AI proposal and the human version stay side by side ("Recommended by AI ·
Human modified", `AI −14 min · Current −9 min`, plus a Reset to the AI order).
- **Effort:** M. Frontend only; no backend.
- **Contributes:** Q1 (three genuinely different framings of the same widget),
  Q2 (a prediction that is stable per order, and never claims high confidence for
  an order it was not seeded on), Q3 (the human-modified action is never
  presented as the AI's).
- **AI4REALNET check:** the *interaction* is grounded in T3.4 / `Tokener`
  (a coordinated priority order is the unit of negotiation) and T2.3
  (expected outcome per alternative). The *prediction* is a deliberate mock —
  the reuse target is the CBS/PP solver in `flatland-blackbox`, behind the
  `ImpactPredictor` seam. Stated explicitly in the spec's §8, not by omission.
- **Spec:** [`widget-e1-combined-actions.md`](widget-e1-combined-actions.md).

## Not widgets (kept off this list deliberately)
- **Full A3S adoption** — architecture stance (service wrapper, Redis/Hydra),
  not a widget; B1 is its minimal in-app expression.
- **Negotiation proxy transparency (FHNW MARL / Tokener)** — needs the MARL
  backend; revisit when real RL agents land (see rl-agents goal).
- **Competence-maintenance / AI-free practice phases** — mode/scenario-level
  design (guardian paradox), not a panel.

## Outside this catalog: information-architecture variants

This catalog lists **AI-novel capabilities** (A–D). A widget can also be worth
building because it rearranges what we already show — those get a spec but no
catalog id, and are tracked in `core/widgets/widget-catalog.ts` like everything
else:

- **Trains v2 · Dispositionstabelle** (`agents-table`, first cut, 2026-08-23) —
  one row per train carrying its situation *and* its action, from the HMI
  review. Variant of the `agents` role, not a new one.
  Spec: [`widget-agents-table.md`](widget-agents-table.md).

## Suggested first wave
**A1 (Risk & Uncertainty)** + **A2 (Decision log)** + **D1 (allocation display)**
— together they materialise Trust, make accountability measurable, and surface
the allocation seam, at ~S+M+M effort. **B1** is the strongest second wave
(Co-Learning §3.3 + A3S pattern), with **C1** as its Assessment complement.
