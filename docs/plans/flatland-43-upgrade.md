# Flatland 4.3.0 — measured upgrade trial

> **Status:** trial run 2026-08-20, **not applied**. The repo stays pinned to
> `flatland-rl==4.2.6`. Every number below was measured on this machine
> (macOS arm64, Python 3.14, `backend/.venv`), not estimated. **Re-checked
> 2026-09-06 against the live upstream repo (§10)** — 4.3.0 is still latest,
> `stations_links`'s actual API is now documented (§10a), and a conflicting
> effort estimate in another doc is flagged (§10d) — read that before trusting
> either doc's number.
>
> **Verdict:** the code migration is about a day. The blocker is not code — it is
> that **seeded worlds change**, which is a study-planning decision (§4).

## 1. The three runs

| Run | Result | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| `4.2.6` (baseline) | 2 failed, 379 passed, 1 skipped | 19:33 |
| `4.3.0` as-is | **165 failed**, 188 passed, 29 errors | 4:58 |
| `4.3.0` + 5-line shim (§3) | **7 failed**, 374 passed, 1 skipped | 18:56 |

Two of the seven were **already red on 4.2.6** (§6). Net new breakage: **5 tests**,
all in one place (§5).

Reproduce:

```bash
cd backend && .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

## 2. What 4.3.0 removed

`EnvAgent` lost its convenience accessors. Probed directly, not inferred:

| 4.2.6 | 4.3.0 |
|---|---|
| `agent.initial_position` | ✗ → `agent.initial_configuration[0]` |
| `agent.initial_direction` | ✗ → `agent.initial_configuration[1]` |
| `agent.position` | ✗ → `agent.current_configuration[0]` (may be `None`) |
| `agent.direction` | ✗ → `agent.current_configuration[1]` |
| `agent.target` | ✗ → `list(agent.targets)[0][0]` (`targets` is a **set**) |

We touch these at roughly **120 call sites across 26 files** (`app/` + `tests/`).

Also changed: `PolicyRunner.create_from_policy` **dropped `start_step` and
`fork_from_trajectory`**. We do not use either (our `start_step` hits are our own
`Policy` lifecycle hook), so this costs us nothing today — but trajectory forking
through that entry point is gone, which matters for
[`widget-b1-whatif-compare.md`](widget-b1-whatif-compare.md).

Everything else we import still exists, including the internal
`NBR_CHACHED_RAND` we depend on in the malfunction generator.

---

## 3. The shim that turns 165 failures into 7

```python
from flatland.envs.agent_utils import EnvAgent

if not hasattr(EnvAgent, "initial_position"):
    EnvAgent.initial_position  = property(lambda s: s.initial_configuration[0])
    EnvAgent.initial_direction = property(lambda s: s.initial_configuration[1])
    EnvAgent.position  = property(lambda s: s.current_configuration[0] if s.current_configuration else None)
    EnvAgent.direction = property(lambda s: s.current_configuration[1] if s.current_configuration else None)
    EnvAgent.target    = property(lambda s: list(s.targets)[0][0])
```

Verified working (`initial_position (21, 10)`, `target (5, 24)` on seed 42).

It is a bridge, not a destination: monkey-patching a third-party `attrs` class is
the kind of thing that breaks silently on the next release. Use it to get the
suite green, then migrate the call sites and delete it.

---

## 4. The actual blocker: seeded worlds change

4.3 changed the sparse rail generator ("one link per gate-gate pair according to
data model", "ban inter-city fibre search from cutting through inner-city
tracks", "fix city naming overflow and drop redundant path search"). Measured
effect — SHA-256 of the rail grid and of the agent origins/targets:

| Seed | grid 4.2.6 | grid 4.3.0 | agents 4.2.6 | agents 4.3.0 | same |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `24e85fb310b31028` | `c0872d33b0ad5b21` | `8ba258e755543440` | `ed9579cb5a22f68c` | **no** |
| 7 | `ab31aa78a7adc30d` | `da691f9b2014905f` | `a6d390e96c32d06f` | `09440298f63d50e8` | **no** |
| 42 | `ef793003c5386edb` | `0dfddf5f635bf414` | `744b1122ecb017da` | `9afbdccd65620913` | **no** |
| 123 | `2b8cf7c9d23208db` | `adba6cbe6395a038` | `259780bbeea974bc` | `71a76caeb7af7a73` | **no** |

Every seed produces a different topology **and** different agent placement.
Consequences:

- Every study scenario defined by a seed becomes a different scenario.
- Sessions recorded before and after the upgrade are **not comparable** — which
  is exactly what [`interaction-logging-plan.md`](interaction-logging-plan.md)
  is trying to make possible.
- 33 of our 44 test files use seeds.

**Therefore: upgrade before a study, never during one.** If a study is running or
imminent, stay on 4.2.6 and revisit after.

---

## 5. The five genuine failures

All five share one root cause — the Director's evaluation-set generator yields
**zero scenarios** under 4.3:

```
assert {s.mix for s in samples} == {"control", "long"}
E   AssertionError: assert set() == {'control', 'long'}
    ValueError: need at least one array to stack
```

- `test_goal_based_eval_set.py` — 2 tests
- `test_goal_based_evaluator.py` — 3 tests

Same origin as §4: the generator changed, and the selection criteria in
`app/policies/goal_based_policies/eval_set.py` no longer match anything. Two
files, but a content question (which scenarios do we still want?), not a
mechanical rename.

---

## 6. Two tests are already red on 4.2.6

Independent of this upgrade, on `explore_db`, reproducing in 0.65 s:

- **`test_hmi_marey_api_contract.py::test_hmi_marey_data_forecast_still_matches_enrichment_contract`**
  — `/hmi/marey-data` returns `{'agents': {}, 'cached': False}`; the test expects
  `cached is True` with enriched agents. The scenario cache is not being reused.
- **`test_infrastructure_scene_session.py::test_infrastructure_scene_switch_visuals_match_builder_canvas`**
  — tile resolution mismatch: `Weiche_horizontal_oben_rechts.svg @180` where
  `Weiche_horizontal_unten_links.svg @0` is expected. The backend tile resolver
  and the builder canvas have drifted apart.

Both violate the CLAUDE.md guardrail "keep existing tests green" and should be
fixed regardless of the version decision.

---

## 7. Packaging: 4.3.0 needs a compiler

| | 4.2.6 | 4.3.0 |
|---|---|---|
| PyPI artifacts | universal wheel (`py2.py3-none-any`) + sdist | **sdist only** |
| Build deps | — | `cython>=3.2.9` |

The build succeeds here in about 30 seconds and produces a platform wheel
(`flatland_rl-4.3.0-cp314-cp314-macosx_26_0_arm64.whl`), but **every target
platform now needs a toolchain**. `backend/Dockerfile` and CI need checking
before anyone upgrades — and this affects the other consortium partners too, not
just us.

---

## 8. What 4.3 would buy us

Not nothing — this is why the question is worth revisiting:

- **`stations_links.py`** — a real data model (`Station` with `gates`,
  `stopping_points`, `Link` with `fibres`). Supersedes most of
  [`cities-stations-plan.md`](cities-stations-plan.md), and models
  multi-track and station capacity natively.
- **`graph/graph_simplification.py`** — an upstream `DecisionPointGraph` with
  edge `len`, overlapping our `infrastructure_graph.py`. Worth de-duplicating.
- **Link-map fixes** (double slips, edge cases) — relevant to
  [`widget-linkmap-zwl.md`](widget-linkmap-zwl.md).
- **Delay rewards** and ECML2026 fine-grained rewards.
- Cython state machine → bigger grids stay affordable.

---

## 9. Recommended order, if we do it

1. Fix the two pre-existing failures first, so "green" means something (§6).
2. Decide the study question (§4). Nothing else matters until that is settled.
3. Land the shim (§3) plus the migration of the ~120 call sites, in one PR.
4. Fix the eval-set selection (§5).
5. Check `Dockerfile` / CI for the build toolchain (§7).
6. Only then consider adopting `stations_links` (§8), which is its own piece of work.

---

## 10. Update, 2026-09-06 — `stations_links` API confirmed, roadmap checked, one doc conflict flagged

Re-verified against the live GitHub repo (code, changelog, milestones), not
just PyPI metadata. **4.3.0 is still latest** (checked `pypi.org/pypi/flatland-rl/json`
today — no 4.3.1/4.4.0 shipped since this doc's 2026-08-20 trial).

### 10a. `stations_links.py`, in full (`flatland/envs/stations_links.py`)

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Pin:
    name: str          # A.N.0, A.N.1, ...
    node: IntVector2D

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Gate:
    name: str          # A.N, A.S, ...
    pins: Dict[int, Pin]

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class StoppingPoint:
    name: str          # A.0, A.1, ...
    node: IntVector2D

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Station:
    name: str          # A, B, ..., Z, AA, AB, ... (Excel-column scheme)
    gates: Dict[str, Gate]           # N, E, S, W
    stopping_points: List[StoppingPoint]
    edges: List[IntVector2D]

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Fibre:
    edges: List[IntVector2D]
    from_pin: str      # A.N.0, A.N.1, ...
    to_pin: str

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Link:
    from_gate: str     # A.N, A.S, ...
    to_gate: str
    fibres: List[Fibre]

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class StationsLinks:
    stations: Dict[str, Station]
    links: List[Link]
```

**`Station.name` is not a human-assignable name** — it's an auto-generated,
stable graph identifier (letters, overflowing to `AA`, `AB`, … per the "fix
city naming overflow" 4.3.0 commit). Don't read adopting this as solving
station *naming* for our HMI — it solves *capture/persistence* of the
city/platform grouping. See [`cities-stations-plan.md`](cities-stations-plan.md)
§5 for the actual naming question, which this data model does not answer.

### 10b. Wiring, confirmed by reading `rail_env.py` and `persistence.py`

- `RailEnv.stations_links` is a new attribute, default `None`
  (`rail_env.py:184,313`), populated from `optionals['stations_links']`
  (`rail_env.py:861-862`) when the rail generator provides it —
  `sparse_rail_generator` always does (`rail_generators.py`: builds it via
  `_extract_stations_links`, returned in `optionals`). **Additive, not
  breaking** — an env just gets a new attribute; nothing reads it unless we
  write code that does.
- `RailEnvPersister` now **round-trips `stations_links`**:
  `persistence.py:325-326` (load: `env.stations_links = env_dict["stations_links"]`)
  and `persistence.py:398-399` (save: `if hasattr(env, "stations_links")`).
  This directly matters for `backend/app/core/station_aware_env.py`'s own
  fork-survival hack (SHA-256 grid fingerprinting, because pre-4.3
  `RailEnvPersister` dropped the hints on `save`→`load_new`) — **post-upgrade,
  that fingerprint registry is likely redundant** for anything migrated to
  `stations_links`. Don't port it into a `stations_links`-based rewrite
  without checking first.

### 10c. Roadmap checked — no station-naming work planned upstream

Searched all 6 open milestones via the GitHub API (not just skimmed the milestones
page): `4.4.0` (Core generalizations for graph representation — 2 issues
closed, 3 open: none about naming), `4.X Cleanup` (12 open, bugfixes/modularization),
`4.Y Observations` (3 open), `4.Z Persistence` (1 open: `#129` "State/configuration
refactoring" — not naming), `4.4.1` (2 open: `#424` "Add event-generator",
`#348` a `DistanceMap`/`DefaultRewards` question re: intermediate stops —
neither about naming), `4.***` "Human Interaction - IAI" (3 open: `#333`
"Implement InteractiveAI Suggestions Protocol API", `#235` "Simulation Stepper
aka. Trajectory API", `#176` "InteractiveAI Unit and Integration Test" — their
own director/negotiation-protocol work, tangential to our
`director-directive` interest per CLAUDE.md, but not station-naming
either). **No open issue anywhere mentions custom/human-readable station
names.** Treat the letter-naming scheme in §10a as upstream's intended
end-state, not a placeholder they'll improve later.

### 10d. Doc conflict to resolve before anyone acts on this

[`flatland-ecosystem-reuse-plan.md`](flatland-ecosystem-reuse-plan.md) §W8
("`flatland-rl` 4.2.6 → 4.3.0") estimates **"Effort: S (bump) + M
(verification)"** and states "Removed APIs (`RailEnv.record_timestep`,
`_apply_timetable_to_agents`) — verified unused by us" **without mentioning**
this doc's §2/§3 finding that `EnvAgent` lost `position`/`target`/
`initial_position`/`initial_direction` entirely (~120 call sites, 165 test
failures without the shim). That doc was written 2026-08-16 per CLAUDE.md;
this doc's trial (§1-§7) ran an actual `pip install flatland-rl==4.3.0` +
full test suite on 2026-08-20 and is the more authoritative source for
migration cost — **but the two haven't been reconciled.** Whoever picks this
up: re-run this doc's §1 trial once more before planning (four days short of
three weeks have passed; confirm nothing upstream changed), then correct or
annotate `flatland-ecosystem-reuse-plan.md` §W8's effort estimate to match
§2/§3 here rather than trusting either doc blindly.
