## 1. The rule

> **Left and centre are the same in all three modes. Only the right column
> differs.**

This is not tidiness, it is the **experimental control**. If a participant
behaves differently in mode 2, that difference has to come from the interaction,
not from the screen having been rearranged. Today the layout is itself a
confounding variable: Director renders `two-col` with no left column at all
([app.component.html:161-170](../../frontend/src/app/app.component.html)), so
"Director felt different" is partly a statement about pixels.

| Zone | Question it answers | Rule |
|------|---------------------|------|
| **Left** | *What is going on?* | Status + events. **Read-only, enforced** |
| **Centre** | *How do I look at it?* | Streckenplan · ZWL · Fahrplan as tabs. Identical |
| **Right** | *What do I do?* | The one decision column. **This is where the mode lives** |

**Read-only means: view yes, act no.** Clicking a train in the left column to
focus it on the map is navigation and stays. Setting an override from there does
not. (Decision, 2026-09-02.)

---

## 2. Starting point, verified in code

Four facts that the plan has to move:

1. **The left column carries dispatch actions.** The trains roster renders
   per-train override buttons
   ([left-sidebar.component.html:96-116](../../frontend/src/app/features/left-sidebar/left-sidebar.component.html)),
   and `agents-table` has a `col-actions` column
   ([agents-table.component.html:104-121](../../frontend/src/app/features/agents-table/agents-table.component.html)).
2. **The centre carries mode decisions.** `director-directive` and
   `strategy-options` sit above the map, `co-learning-reflection` below it
   ([app.component.html:176-268](../../frontend/src/app/app.component.html)).
   Both belong to the right column under the rule above.
3. **The Fahrplan is in no mode layout.** `timetable` is registered as a centre
   view ([center-views.ts:33](../../frontend/src/app/features/view-tabs/center-views.ts))
   but only the Combined-Actions preset configures it.
4. ~~**Zone detection is string-sniffing and gets presets wrong.**~~ **Fixed
   2026-09-11 — and it was worse than described.** The sniffing in
   `toRuntimeZone()` does read a column named `"Entscheidung"` as `left`, but the
   designed-layout path never called it: it bound `[panel]="panel"` straight from
   the design, and a design's panel objects carry **no `zone` at all**
   (`LayoutPresetPanel` has id/type/title/expanded/collapsible/minHeight/settings).
   So a zone-derived rule was not wrong in a preset, it was *inert*. Now
   `LayoutPresetColumn` declares `zone`, all four presets set it, and
   `runtimeZonedPanel()` resolves column zone → legacy sniffing → panel, cached
   per column+panel for a stable reference.

---

## 3. Left zone — three slots, filled per mode

Same three slots everywhere; what fills them may differ, because a Director's
"what is going on" is not a dispatcher's. Notifications alone would leave
Director's left column empty — measured over ~120 steps, the feed there reports
nothing, since malfunctions and operator overrides are the two things that do not
happen in that mode (see the comment at
[app.component.html:317-321](../../frontend/src/app/app.component.html)).

| Slot | Recommendation | Co-Learning | Director |
|------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Status** | `situation-summary` | `situation-summary` | `situation-summary` + **`goal-achievement`** |
| **Events** | `notifications` | `notifications` | `notifications` + **`ai-activity`** |
| **Trains** | `agents` *(read-only)* | `agents` *(read-only)* | — *(Director does not dispatch per train)* |

Two things fall out of this that are worth having on their own:

- **`goal-achievement` comes back.** It is offered in *no* mode today
  (`'goal-achievement': []` in
  [panel-mode-availability.ts](../../frontend/src/app/core/layout/panel-mode-availability.ts))
  because the A/B/C strategy tiles superseded it as a *decision* surface. As a
  pure status readout with no lever it is exactly what the left zone wants, and
  it is `shipped` code that currently renders nowhere.
- **`ai-activity` moves left.** It is a feed without actions; it was only ever in
  the right column because Director had no left column to put it in.

### Enforcing read-only

> **First slice landed 2026-09-08 ("Guide Mode light"), completed 2026-09-11

Derive it from the zone rather than writing it into each widget:
`panel.zone === 'left'` ⇒ the host passes `readonly` to the widget. `PanelInstance`
already carries `zone`
([layout.models.ts:60](../../frontend/src/app/core/layout/models/layout.models.ts)),
and `panel-plugin-host` already receives the whole `PanelInstance`, so the seam
exists. Only three widgets need to honour the flag today (`agents` →
`left-sidebar`, `agents-table`, `notifications`' dismiss); everything else in the
left zone is already passive. Selection/focus emissions stay untouched.

---

## 4. Centre zone — one `view-tabs` container

`Streckenplan (flatland-map)` · `ZWL (marey)` · `Fahrplan (timetable)`, in every
mode, via `settings.tabs: ['flatland-map', 'marey', 'timetable']`. The container
is registry-driven and already does this; what is missing is the configuration in
the mode layouts.

### Does that make sense for Director? Yes — but not with the ZWL as default

**Corrected 2026-09-07 (danib).** An earlier draft made the ZWL Director's
default view, arguing that plan-vs-actual is a time question. The objection that
overturned it: **a ZWL shows one line section, and Director supervises a whole
network.** The reason is structural, not a matter of taste — the Marey's y-axis
is a *linearisation* of cells (`backend/app/core/marey_topology.py`), so it
presumes that a line exists. On the PF–CH corridor (191×9) that holds; on Olten
(35×60, a station area, 52 trains) the axis is a fiction. The ZWL is a corridor
instrument, not a network instrument, and it stays an available tab rather than
the default.

| Mode | Default tab | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Recommendation | Streckenplan | resolve a conflict spatially, where it happens |
| Co-Learning | Streckenplan | "my plan (blue) vs AI plan (yellow)" is drawn on the map |
| **Director** | **Streckenplan** | the whole network at once; the ZWL presumes a corridor |

`MODE_DEFAULT_VIEW` ([view-tabs.component.ts:14-18](../../frontend/src/app/features/view-tabs/view-tabs.component.ts))
loses its Director special case (`'goal-achievement'` → `'flatland-map'`, same as
the other two) — see the deeper correction below.

### But the map alone does not answer Director's question either

Director's input is an *objective* — minimise delay ↔ hold connections ↔ maximise
stability. What an objective changes is mostly **order and timing**: who waits,
who goes first, which transfer survives. On a map a waiting train looks almost
like a running one. The map answers *where* and *which route*; it does not answer
*what did my input do*.

The material for that answer already exists and is currently discarded. Every
Director preview returns `DirectorDivergence`
([api.service.ts:259-265](../../frontend/src/app/core/api.service.ts)):

```ts
reroutes: { handle → { branch: {row, col, step}, points: [...] } }
holds:    [ { handle, row, col, steps } ]
```

Per train: from which point it drives differently, or how long it waits. Today
that is compressed into a one-line badge over the map ("3 Zug/Züge fahren anders,
1 wartet"). So the centre gains two things, neither of them a new computation:

1. **A "Was ändert sich" companion** beside the map — the affected trains, sorted
   by magnitude, each row naming its change (*Route ab Zbf* / *wartet 6
   Schritte*). Pointing at a row draws that train's route on the map; the
   mechanism exists (`directorHoverHandle`, deliberately one at a time). It is a
   **companion, not a tab**: tabs are mutually exclusive, and here cause (map) and
   effect (list) must be readable at the same time. Whether it ships as a new
   panel type or as the Director variant of `impact` is an implementation choice —
   note that `impact` is conflict-shaped today, while this is plan-vs-plan.
2. **A Δ column in the Fahrplan** against the running plan (`+3'`, `−7'`, order
   swap). The timetable's columns today are Train/From/To/Via/Dep/Arr/Now/Status —
   the timing consequence of an objective appears in none of them.

The map keeps the Director look-ahead overlay (`directorPreviewPaths`): it is
supervisory evidence, not a lever.

### The deeper correction: the default view belongs to the scenario, not the mode

The ZWL is right for a corridor and wrong for a station area — that is a property
of the **network**, not of the interaction mode. Hardcoding a default per mode is
therefore the wrong seam. The default view belongs to the **experimental setup**
([scenario-infrastructure-gallery.md](scenario-infrastructure-gallery.md) §4.4),
with `MODE_DEFAULT_VIEW` as the fallback when an experimental setup names none.

This also settles §10.4 below (should the Fahrplan filter default differ per
mode?) the same way: data on the experimental setup, not a branch on the mode. It keeps §1's
"identical centre" intact — the centre is identical *per scenario*, which is what
a study compares within.

**Later, not now:** the honest network-scale answer to the question the ZWL
answers for a corridor is a different view — rows = the contended resources
(stations, single-track sections), x = time, cell = occupancy. That would show
"my stability objective spread the load". New work, L; the two items above use
data that already exists and come first.

---

## 5. Right zone — per mode

### 5.1 Recommendation (WP 3.1) — a stack, one reading order

```
Empfehlung (confidence + countdown)      recommendations
  └ reliability strip                    risk-uncertainty, embedded
Folgen: who is affected                  impact
Zug-Detail (the intervention)            agent-inspector
Entscheidungsprotokoll (collapsed)       decision-log
```

*Suggestion → reliability → consequence → intervention.* **No segments here**
(decision, 2026-09-02): Recommendation should feel fast and unambiguous, and a
tab bar in front of a single decision surface is friction. It is the only mode
whose right column reads top-to-bottom in one pass.

The `agent-inspector` carries more weight than today, because the left roster
loses its buttons: together with the map's agent overlay it becomes *the*
intervention surface.

`risk-uncertainty` moves from "its own panel somewhere" to a strip inside the
recommendation card. An uncertainty number that is not adjacent to the claim it
qualifies is not calibration support, it is decoration.

### 5.2 Co-Learning (WP 3.3) — segmented: Entscheiden / Explorieren / Reflektieren

Five stacked panels do not fit a 26 % column, and the mode genuinely has three
distinct activities. A segmented control at the head of the right column — the
same idea as `view-tabs`, applied to the right zone (new container widget
`decision-tabs`, see §6):

| Segment | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| **Entscheiden** | `combined-actions` in neutral framing (A/B/C, no badge, no ranking) + `agent-inspector` |
| **Explorieren** | `whatif-compare` (B1, blue = mine / yellow = AI), free branching |
| **Reflektieren** | `co-learning-reflection`, with `decision-log` beneath it as the evidence |

The **Reflektieren** segment carries a badge when a reflection moment is pending.
The selection logic exists and is transparently scored — pattern deviation,
override, deferral, confirmed preference, max 3 per run
([reflection-moments.ts](../../frontend/src/app/core/reflection-moments.ts)) —
and `store.reflectionRequested` is already the signal that opens it. This gets
reflection out of the centre (where it sat under the map, collapsed, easy to
miss) without burying it at the bottom of a long column.

Exploration and reflection are the two things this mode is *for*, so they get
equal billing with the decision itself rather than sharing its scroll.

### 5.3 Director (WP 3.4) — a stack, objective first

```
Auftrag setzen / autonomen Lauf starten    director-directive   (from the centre)
Zielsetzung A/B/C                          strategy-options     (from the centre)
Autonomiegrad                              NEW (§6)
Prognose der gewählten Strategie           strategy-forecast
Reflexion & Gelerntes (collapsed)          strategy-reflection
                                           + co-learning-effect + learning-records
```

`ai-activity` moves left. The three learning panels become one collapsible block:
they are three views of the same object and cost three panel headers today.

**The honest cost of this move.** `strategy-options` sits in the centre on
purpose — "decide here, see it on the map below, read the consequence under the
map", and the forecast was moved out of that slot precisely because stacking it
there pushed the map off a laptop screen
([app.component.html:180-199](../../frontend/src/app/app.component.html)). In a
26 % column the A/B/C tiles have to stack vertically instead of sitting side by
side, which weakens the "compare three at a glance" reading. What survives is the
coupling to the map: hovering a tile already drives the dashed look-ahead overlay,
so "decide right, see centre" replaces "decide above, see below". If the vertical
tiles turn out to read badly, the fallback is a wider right column in Director
only (32 %) — a layout constant, not a structural exception.

### 5.4 The guided demo's copy is part of the layout

The guided demo tells the operator where to look *before* each mode starts, and
that copy is data, not prose in a component: `MODE_INTROS`
([mode-intro-configs.ts](../../frontend/src/app/core/demo/mode-intro-configs.ts))
carries a `focusView` field per mode, grounded — its own comment says so — in
[center-view-tabs.md](center-view-tabs.md). Change the layouts without changing
it and the demo actively misdirects.

What breaks when §3–§5 land:

| Line | Today | After |
|------|-------|-------|
| Director `focusView` | *"The Goal Achievement dashboard"* | the Streckenplan plus the "Was ändert sich" companion; Goal Achievement is a **status readout on the left**, not the place to look |
| Director `watchFor` | *"A live 'Goal Achievement' panel once it's running"* | left-column status + the A/B/C tiles on the right |
| Recommendation `watchFor` | *"a recommendation card on the right"* | still true — plus the reliability strip inside it (§5.1) |
| Co-Learning `watchFor` | *"'Reflect now' becomes available"* | it is a **segment with a badge**, not a link (§5.2) |

And one line is **already wrong today**, independent of this plan: both
Recommendation and Co-Learning promise *"Adjust KPI priorities"*, but `kpi-filter`
is offered in no mode (`'kpi-filter': []`) and `kpiPriorities` sits at its
defaults. The demo has been promising a lever that is not on screen.

So the intro copy is an acceptance criterion of P2/P3, not a follow-up: **every
`focusView` / `watchFor` / `whatYouCanControl` line must name something the mode
actually shows.** Cheapest guard is a test that asserts each `whatYouCanControl`
entry maps to a panel type available in that mode — the availability map is
already data, so the check is a lookup, not a fixture.

The same applies to `DemoCompleteComponent`, whose copy is hardcoded in its
template rather than in a config; it is the one screen in the demo flow with no
data seam. Moving it to a config beside `MODE_INTROS` is S and makes the whole
guided flow reviewable in one file.

---

## 6. Widget work

| Widget | What changes | Effort |
|--------|--------------|:------:|
| `agents` / `agents-table` | honour `readonly` from the zone; hide action affordances, keep selection | S |
| `notifications` | `readonly` (no dismiss in the left zone) — decide whether dismiss counts as an action | S |
| `ai-activity` | render as a left-zone feed peer next to notifications | S |
| `goal-achievement` | re-enable for Director (`['director']` instead of `[]`), left zone, status framing | S |
| `risk-uncertainty` | embed as a strip inside the recommendation card | S |
| `view-tabs` | Fahrplan tab in all mode layouts; Director default `marey` | S |
| **`decision-tabs`** | **new** — right-column segment container; registry-driven like `view-tabs` | S |
| `timetable` | filter "affected / delayed only" — 52 trains (Olten) are unreadable otherwise | S–M |
| **"Was ändert sich" companion** | **new** — renders `DirectorDivergence` beside the map, hover-linked (§4); today a one-line badge | S–M |
| `timetable` Δ column | delta against the running plan (`+3'`, order swap) — the timing side of a Director objective | S |
| `strategy-options` | vertical tile layout for a sidebar column | S–M |
| `co-learning-reflection` | **collect**: one reflection artefact per run + JSON export, so reflections are study data and not just UI state | M |
| `whatif-compare` (B1) | **free exploration**: branch from any train/step, hold and compare several branches (the TraceRL branching-tree pattern) | M–L |
| **Autonomy dial / allocation** | **new** — `planned` in the catalog; the adjustable-autonomy lever D3.1 §7 asks for, and the thing that makes Director more than "the AI runs, you watch" | M |
| `marey` (ZWL) | B2: conflict ribbons + plan-vs-actual. The largest single lever for Director supervision | L |
| `mode-intro` / `demo-complete` | intro copy follows the new layouts (§5.4) + a test that every promised lever exists in that mode; `demo-complete` copy into a config | S |

Effort scale per [widget-catalog.md](widget-catalog.md): S ≤150k tokens/≤1 day ·
M 150–400k/1–3 days · L >400k/3–5+ days.

**The two development priorities** are free exploration in B1 (without it
Co-Learning only reacts, it never explores) and the autonomy dial (without it
Director has no adjustable autonomy, only autonomy).

---

## 7. Scenario — 2–3 events, sampled not scripted

Today there are two extremes and nothing between them: **disturbance files** at
fixed steps (deterministic, `malfunction_rate: 0`,
[disruptions.py](../../backend/app/core/disruptions.py)) or **random
malfunctions** via the rate — where the number of events is whatever the seed
gives. What a study wants is a *bounded* number of *unauthored* events.

### Event budget

A third layer, `backend/app/core/event_budget.py`, beside `disruptions.py`:

```json
{
  "count": [2, 3],
  "windows": [[10, 45], [45, 95], [95, 145]],
  "types": { "train_delay": 0.5, "area_block": 0.3, "warning": 0.2 },
  "targets": "conflict_prone",
  "min_spacing": 20,
  "quiet_tail": 30
}
```

The sampler draws 2–3 events, at most one per window, with the step drawn inside
the window and the type drawn by weight. The **target** is drawn only from
eligible candidates — a train approaching the single-track section, a cell with a
viable alternative route — so every event is consequential without its timing or
its victim being authored. Guard rails: minimum spacing, no event inside the
closing window (consequences must play out), and a feasibility check against the
planner so a draw cannot produce an unresolvable deadlock.

It reuses the existing event vocabulary and application path entirely
(`train_delay` becomes a Flatland malfunction, so the state machine, the delay
KPI, the map badge and the notifications treat it exactly like an emergent
breakdown). No new HMI concept.

**Seeding:** an `event_seed` separate from the env `seed`
([session.py:9](../../backend/app/models/session.py)). Same env, different event
draw is one parameter; the same draw replays exactly. `malfunction_rate` stays 0
so the budget *is* the event count.

### Which scenario

`pf-ch-corridor-stops` — 16 trains with intermediate calls, so knock-on effects
and connections actually exist. The 3-train `wn-wal` conflict scenarios are too
small: a second event has nothing to interact with. Olten stays the "environment
we did not design the answer for" validation case, not the demo default.

### Events are re-drawn per mode

Decision, 2026-09-02. The guided demo runs the three modes on the same
environment; if it also ran the same event draw, a participant would arrive at
mode 3 already knowing the answer, and the mode comparison would measure recall.
So: **same budget, a different `event_seed` per mode**, with the seed set fixed
per participant and the mode order counterbalanced (Latin square). Comparability
comes from the budget and the network being identical, not from the incident
being identical.

Trade-off, stated so it is not rediscovered later: variance between modes now has
an event-draw component. The budget's guard rails (fixed count, fixed windows,
eligible-target rule) are what keep that variance bounded; if a study needs
tighter control, a drawn set can be frozen to a disturbance file and replayed —
the formats are compatible by construction.

---

## 8. Sequencing

- **P0 — zones become data. ✅ landed 2026-09-11.** Add an explicit `zone: 'left' | 'center' | 'right'`
  to `LayoutPresetColumn`, keep `toRuntimeZone()`'s string-sniffing only as the
  legacy fallback (§2.4). Nothing else in this plan is safe until a right column
  is actually typed `right`.
- **P1 — the three layouts as presets.** Write Recommendation / Co-Learning /
  Director into [layout-presets.ts](../../frontend/src/app/core/layout/layout-presets.ts)
  so they are reviewable and diffable, instead of growing the hardcoded default
  further. Needs P1 of [mode-scoped-layouts-plan.md](mode-scoped-layouts-plan.md)
  — the resolver that picks a layout from `interactionMode()` — otherwise the
  presets stay manually chosen and the saved-layout path keeps bypassing mode
  behaviour.
- **P2 — read-only left zone** (the `readonly` flag + the three widgets), and the
  moves that need no new code: `ai-activity` left, `goal-achievement` re-enabled,
  Fahrplan tab, Director default tab. Ships with the corrected guided-demo copy
  (§5.4) — a mode whose intro screen points at a panel that moved is worse than
  the old layout.
- **P3 — `decision-tabs`** + the Co-Learning segments; `strategy-options` vertical.
- **P4 — event budget** (backend, testable on its own, independent of P0–P3).
- **P5 — the development items:** B1 free exploration, autonomy dial, reflection
  collection/export, then B2.

---

## 9. Guardrails

- Frontend work here is presentation and layout selection only. Do not touch
  `_recordTrajectory` or the scenario-refresh throttling; do not reshape payloads
  to suit a column.
- `InteractionMode` stays the single mode flag. A layout is *selected by* the
  mode; it never becomes a second mode flag.
- Availability stays in `panel-mode-availability.ts`; behaviour stays inside the
  components reading `store.interactionMode()`. This plan changes *where* panels
  render, and adds `readonly` — it does not add a third gating mechanism.
- No hardcoded colours in any new container (`decision-tabs` follows the
  `view-tabs` token usage).
- Backend: the event budget is additive next to `disruptions.py`; existing
  scripted scenarios and their tests keep working unchanged. New gating needs
  coverage in `backend/tests/`.

---

## 10. Open questions

1. **Does "dismiss" count as an action?** Dismissing a notification changes no
   train, but it changes what the operator sees later — and in a study it is
   recorded behaviour. Draft: keep it, it is annotation, not dispatch.
2. **Director right column width.** 26 % like the others (consistency) or 32 %
   (the A/B/C tiles read better)? Decide after seeing the vertical tiles.
3. **Where does `combined-actions` belong in Recommendation?** The matrix gives
   it a recommendation framing in that mode, but the column above has no slot for
   it. Either it replaces `impact` there, or Recommendation keeps a single-action
   surface and E1 stays a Co-Learning/Director widget.
4. **Timetable filter default.** "Affected only" by default is readable but hides
   the plan; "all, affected highlighted" is honest but unreadable at 52 trains.
   Probably mode-dependent — which contradicts §4's "identical centre" and should
   therefore be data-driven, not mode-driven.
