# Widget spec — Netz-Zeitansicht (Network Time View)

> **Status:** spec, not built. Dated 2026-09-07.
> **Why it exists:** [mode-layouts-three-zones.md](mode-layouts-three-zones.md) §4
> first proposed the ZWL as Director's default view and then had to retract it —
> a Marey's y-axis is a *linearisation* of cells, so it presumes a line exists.
> That holds for the PF–CH corridor and is a fiction for Olten. This widget is
> the network-scale answer to the question the ZWL answers for a corridor:
> **is the plan going to fit, and what did my objective change?**

## 1 · Identity

- **Name:** Netz-Zeitansicht (Network Time View)
- **Type / slug:** `network-time-view`
- **Catalog id:** **B5** (B4 is the Link-Map/ZWL port, see
  [widget-linkmap-zwl.md](widget-linkmap-zwl.md))
- **`kind`:** Prediction — it shows the planned future and an alternative to it,
  not the current state. Same family as B2.
- **`granularity`:** overview → detail (rows are the overview; pointing at a bar
  is the per-train detail)
- **Default zone:** center
- **Source origin:** `from-scratch UI, deliberately` — but **not** a from-scratch
  *concept*: see grounding.
- **Grounding reference:** the railway **Belegungs-/Sperrzeitendarstellung** —
  occupancy of infrastructure elements over time, the standard instrument of
  railway capacity analysis (blocking-time theory, UIC 406). This widget is a
  simplified blocking-time diagram at *resource* granularity rather than at
  block-section granularity. The ZWL/Marey is its time-**distance** sibling; both
  are control-room practice, they differ in what the y-axis carries.

## 2 · Promise

> Read whether the plan fits through the network's bottlenecks — and see, in the
> same picture, what your objective changed and what it cost.

Differentiation from what exists (checked against `widget-catalog.ts`):

- **`marey` / ZWL** (prediction) — time × *distance along a line*. Needs a line.
  Complementary, not superseded: for a corridor it is the better view.
- **B2 conflict-aware Marey** — adds ribbons to that same linear axis; inherits
  the same precondition.
- **`flatland-map`** (event) — space, no time. Shows *where*, not *when*, and a
  waiting train looks much like a running one.
- **`timetable`** (context) — per train, not per resource. Answers "what is train
  X supposed to do", not "does resource Y hold".
- **B3 network correlation graph** (context) — relational, not temporal.

## 3 · Per-mode behaviour

Offered in **all three modes**; the *framing* differs, and so does the colour
convention, which matters because the repo already has one.

- **Director (WP 3.4) — the primary mode.** Four selectable plan states, not
  two: the **baseline** plus the three focuses the mode actually offers
  (`STRATEGY_COPY` — *Verspätung minimieren* · *Anschlüsse halten* ·
  *Stabilität maximieren*). Every plan is the AI's, so the encoding is **neutral
  by identity and loud by change**: unchanged occupancy grey, occupancy this
  focus moved accented, and **the baseline always as the dashed ghost**. Reading
  stays two-at-a-time — the selected focus against doing nothing — even though
  four states are selectable. This is the evidence surface for the A/B/C
  decision; it does not carry the decision (`strategy-options` does).
- **Recommendation (WP 3.1).** One plan plus the AI's proposed action: the ghost
  is *what the recommendation would do*. The contended resource and the window
  are named, so accepting or overriding has a visible consequence.
- **Co-Learning (WP 3.3).** Two plans of *different authorship*, so the existing
  convention wins over the one above: **human-influenced blue, AI-simulated
  yellow** (`--app-whatif-human` / `--app-whatif-ai`, the A3S/TraceRL convention
  from CLAUDE.md and widget B1). Neutral: neither plan is marked better.

Read-only in every mode (`writes: 'view'` — hover and selection only).

### 3b · The baseline is not optional

"Doing nothing" — every train follows its line, nobody intervenes — is a plan
state like the other three, and it is the reference the other three are drawn
against. The argument for it is not symmetry; it is already measured in this
repo. The Director acceptance sweep (12 scenarios, seed 42, every row verified by
a full episode — [director-mode.md](../reference/director-mode.md) §8):

| weights | mean delay | arrived rate | mean kept ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **lines (baseline)** | 62.9 | 0.50 | **0.753** |
| punctuality (1,0,0) | **55.7** | 0.58 | 0.601 |
| connections (0,1,0) | 70.6 | 0.50 | 0.736 |
| stability (0,0,1) | 60.1 | 0.50 | 0.660 |

**The connections focus keeps fewer connections than doing nothing** — 0.736
against 0.753 — and pays 15 delay for it. Punctuality and stability do win on
their own axis; that one does not. `director-strategy-copy.ts` already says so in
a code comment, and the B tile is deliberately worded as an intent rather than a
promise because of it.

Without a baseline state, that is invisible in the HMI: three focuses shown only
against each other always look like three working levers. With it, the operator
can see a directive that changes a lot and improves nothing. This is exactly the
calibrated-trust question (**Q2**) — and it makes the widget an instrument for
catching our *own* over-claiming, not only the operator's over-trust.

The baseline here is the same object the experimental setup catalogue wants per experimental setup
([scenario-infrastructure-gallery.md](scenario-infrastructure-gallery.md) §6):
one recorded no-intervention run. One definition, two consumers — do not grow a
second one.

**What this widget must not become.** Four states are selectable, but only two
are ever drawn: the selected one and the ghost. Showing all four at once is a
different widget — the trade-off frontier / small-multiples (**C1** in the
catalog). Keep that boundary; a four-plan overlay is unreadable and would
duplicate C1 badly.

## 4 · System interaction

**Data in**

| Need | Source | State |
|---|---|---|
| Train positions over time | `store.history()` / trajectory signals (already feeding `marey-chart`) | ✓ exists |
| The previewed alternative plan | `store.directorPreviewPaths()`, `directorPreviewDivergence()` | ✓ exists |
| Station identity | `SessionStore.stations()` (shared registry, also used by the map stations layer) | ✓ exists |
| **The resource rows** (which cells form "Süd-Ost 59/13–14") | — | ✗ to build, see §4b |
| **Capacity per resource** | — | ✗ to build (declared on the Netz) |

**Actions out** — none that change the run. Hover sets
`store.directorHoverHandle` (Director) / `setAgentHoverAgents` (the pattern
`marey-chart` already uses), so pointing at a bar highlights the same train on the
map and in the Fahrplan. Selection is shared state, not widget-local.

### 4b · The resource rows can be *derived*, not declared

The finding that makes this widget affordable. Reading `olten.pkl` directly:
52 agents carry **24 distinct waypoint cells**, and 23 of them have an
intermediate call between origin and destination. Those waypoint cells cluster
exactly into the infrastructure the timetable cares about — in Olten, row 37
columns 7–16 (the platform tracks) plus four line portals.

**So the row set comes from the timetable for free.** What still has to be
declared is:

1. **Capacity** per resource (a platform track is 1, a four-track station is 4).
2. **Sections nobody calls at** — a single-track stretch is a resource with no
   waypoint on it. These are exactly the `bottlenecks` field proposed in
   [scenario-infrastructure-gallery.md](scenario-infrastructure-gallery.md) §4.1.
3. **Grouping and naming** — merging adjacent cells into one readable row.

This partially answers that plan's open question §10.1 ("is `affords` declared or
derived?"): for station-shaped resources, derived; for sections, declared.

**Backend table**

| Capability | Available now | To build (flagged) |
|---|---|:---:|
| Agent trajectories `(i, t, r, c)` | ✓ | |
| Waypoints per agent incl. scheduled times | ✓ in the env (`agent.waypoints`, `waypoints_earliest_departure/_latest_arrival`) — **not currently exposed by any endpoint** | ✓ expose |
| Resource registry (rows + capacity + member cells) | | ✓ new — `GET /{id}/hmi/resources`, following `models/hmi.py` conventions |
| Occupancy intervals per resource per plan | | ✓ derive — from trajectories server-side, or in the frontend from data it already holds |
| Capacity violation spans | | ✓ trivial once the two above exist |

Honest scoping: the first cut can derive occupancy in the frontend from the
trajectory signals it already receives, with a declared resource list shipped as
Netz metadata. Nothing here needs a new algorithm; it needs a vocabulary.

## 5 · Allocation & accountability

- **Loop stage:** *monitor / assess*, never *act*. It is the evidence behind the
  Director's one decision, not the decision surface.
- **Owner (`allocation`):** the AI owns the plans being compared in Director and
  Recommendation; in Co-Learning one of the two branches is the human's.
- **Decision events emitted:** none of its own — a deliberate boundary. The
  decision record belongs to `strategy-options` (Director) / the recommendation
  accept-or-override (Recommendation).
- **Possible study instrument (optional, off by default):** which resource rows
  the operator pointed at before deciding is attention data, and would feed the
  same seam as
  [interaction-logging-plan.md](interaction-logging-plan.md). Flagged, not
  assumed — logging gaze-like proxies needs a consent decision, not a code
  decision.

## 6 · Acceptance scenario

Olten, the window from step 100 to 620 (the real fixture data, §9.2).

1. The operator is in Director, on **Nichtstun (Referenz)**. The row
   **Süd-Ost 59/13–14** carries a red band at steps 385–395: h11 is leaving
   southbound while h15 is entering from the south, on a capacity-1 approach.
   Nobody has intervened; this is what the shift costs if they do not.
2. **Verspätung minimieren** — three bars move, all h15's: it enters 10 steps
   later, calls at Gleis 37/13 ten steps later, leaves eastbound ten steps later.
   Band gone, every arrival window still held.
3. **Anschlüsse halten** — five bars move: h15 as above, plus h13 waiting at
   Gleis 37/11 for the transfer and leaving eastbound at 480. Band gone, the
   transfer kept — and h13 now misses its own arrival window of 460.
4. **Stabilität maximieren** — three bars move: h15 waits 40 steps at the south
   portal for the largest margin at the approach, and its eastbound slot lands
   after its window of 560.

The operator commits one, having seen what each costs *relative to not acting*.

**Measurable success criterion:** shown the baseline and the three focuses, an
operator names (a) the resource that stopped being contended and (b) the train
that pays, for each focus, without opening another panel. Target ≥ 80 % correct
on both parts. Ties to **Q1** (Director's supervision gets an instrument of its
own) and **Q2** (the cost of a directive is visible against doing nothing, not
asserted).

## 7 · Effort & changes

**L overall** (>400k tokens / 3–5 days), decomposing into three parts that can
land separately:

| Part | Effort |
|---|:---:|
| The view itself (rendering, lanes, hover linkage, mode framing) | M |
| Resource registry + capacity as Netz metadata (backend + fixtures) | S–M |
| Occupancy derivation for both plan states | M |

Registration points (per
[widget-authoring-process.md](../reference/widget-authoring-process.md)):
`features/network-time-view/`, `panel-plugin-host` (`@switch` + `.ts`),
`layout-designer` palette, `panel-mode-availability.ts`,
`core/widgets/widget-catalog.ts`, and `features/view-tabs/center-views.ts` (it is
a centre view, so it belongs in the tab registry).

**Sequencing:** this comes *after* the two cheap items in
[mode-layouts-three-zones.md](mode-layouts-three-zones.md) §4 — the
"Was ändert sich" companion and the Fahrplan Δ column — which answer a thinner
version of the same question using data that already exists.

## 8 · Open questions / risks

1. **Occupancy width.** A fixture gives scheduled *times*, not occupancy
   *durations*. Real widths come from trajectories at runtime; for a *previewed*
   plan they come from the forward simulation. Widths for a plan that has not been
   simulated would have to be estimated — and an estimated bar next to a measured
   one is exactly the kind of quiet fiction the provenance rules exist to prevent.
   Draft: only ever draw simulated plans; no estimation.
2. **How many rows before it stops being readable?** Olten needs ~11 in a 480-step
   window. A larger station area could need 40. Filtering (only contended
   resources, only resources on a changed train's path) is then not a nicety.
3. **Row order.** Geographic order is meaningless without a line — that is the
   premise of this widget. Candidates: by contention, by first occupancy, grouped
   by station/approach. Probably operator-switchable, defaulting to grouped.
4. **Does it subsume B2?** If conflict ribbons are added here, a conflict-aware
   Marey may only be worth building for corridor scenarios. Decide when B2 comes
   up, not now — B2 has a UIX cross-model mandate this widget does not.
5. **Two colour conventions in one widget** (§3) is a real risk: grey/accent in
   Director, blue/yellow in Co-Learning. The alternative — blue/yellow everywhere
   — would claim human authorship for a plan the human did not write. Keeping two
   conventions is the lesser evil, but it must be visible in the legend.

## 9 · Worked examples

> **Interactive:** [`docs/widget-b5-network-time-view-mockup.html`](../widget-b5-network-time-view-mockup.html)
> renders both examples with a focus toggle — open it in a browser, no build step.
> The tables below are the same data, so the spec stays readable on its own.

### 9.1 Corridor (the simple case)

Resources are the stations and the single-track sections along the line; the same
view degenerates gracefully to what a ZWL would show, because a corridor's
resources happen to be linearly ordered. Occupancy windows of RE4820, the train
every focus moves:

| Resource | Cap. | Nichtstun | Verspätung min. | Anschlüsse | Stabilität |
|---|:--:|---|---|---|---|
| Einspur WN–WAL | 1 | 30–46 → **Konflikt 30–34** | 36–52 | 40–56 | 50–66 |
| Bf Walenstadt | 2 | 22–30 | 22–30 | 22–**40** | 22–**50** |
| Tunnel Murg | 1 | 48–60 | 54–66 | 58–70 | 68–80 |
| Bf Sargans | 3 | 62–74 | 68–80 | 72–84 | 82–94 |
| Bf Bad Ragaz | 2 | 78–88 | 84–94 | 88–98 | 98–108 |

Four bars move under punctuality, five under the other two. The trade the
operator reads: 6 steps later and the conflict is gone, 10 later and the transfer
with S12 holds, 20 later and the approach has its largest margin. Illustrative
numbers, not from a fixture.

### 9.2 Olten (the case that motivates the widget)

**From `backend/app/fixtures/olten/olten.pkl`, read 2026-09-07:** 60 × 35 grid,
518 track cells, 52 agents, `max_episode_steps` 1300, departures spread over steps
0–1140. 24 distinct waypoint cells. The platform cluster is row 37, columns 7–16;
the portals are row 0 cols 23–24 (north), row 59 cols 4–5 and 13–14 (south-west,
south-east), col 34 (east), col 0 (west).

The 14 trains departing between steps 60 and 420 — real handles and real
scheduled times (the view's window runs to 620 so the stability variant's
eastbound slot still fits):

| Handle | Start | `earliest_departure` | Call (row 37) | Target | `latest_arrival` |
|---|---|--:|---|---|--:|
| h5 | 37/13 | 100 | 37/13 @ 100 | 59/5 | 160 |
| h7 | 0/24 | 100 | 37/15 | 37/15 | 200 |
| h6 | 37/15 | 120 | 37/15 @ 120 | 59/14 | 160 |
| h10 | 21/34 | 140 | 37/13 @ 240 | 59/14 | 300 |
| h8 | 37/7 | 220 | 37/7 @ 220 | 49/0 | 300 |
| h9 | 37/14 | 240 | 37/14 @ 240 | 0/23 | 320 |
| h49 | 0/24 | 280 | — | 18/34 | 320 |
| h14 | 21/34 | 300 | 37/9 @ 400 | 37/9 | 420 |
| h11 | 37/16 | 320 | 37/16 @ 320 | 59/14 | 380 |
| h12 | 37/15 | 340 | 37/15 @ 340 | 0/23 | 440 |
| h13 | 59/4 | 340 | 37/11 @ 400 | 20/34 | 460 |
| h16 | 49/0 | 360 | 37/7 | 37/7 | 480 |
| h15 | 59/13 | 400 | 37/13 @ 460 | 20/34 | 560 |
| h17 | 21/34 | 400 | 37/9 | 37/9 | 480 |

Rows for this window: seven platform tracks (37/7, 37/9, 37/11, 37/13, 37/14,
37/15, 37/16) and five approaches (Nord, Süd-West, Süd-Ost, Ost, West) — **twelve
rows for fifty-two trains**, of which fourteen are in the window. That ratio is
the argument: the view's height is set by the infrastructure, the traffic only
makes the rows denser. The map scales the other way.
