# Recommender roadmap — two pluggable seams

Goal: stay flexible so other / trained (RL) algorithms can be plugged in later,
and keep **policy change (system-wide strategy)** separate from **intervention
recommendation (local fix for a malfunction)**.

## The two seams

1. **Agent / Policy seam** — drives the trains. Existing `app/policies` registry.
   Heuristics, PP/CBS planners, and trained RL (PPO) all implement `Policy` and
   register. This is where RL ultimately lives (a trained model = one more Policy).
2. **Intervention recommender seam** — suggests the local action for a
   malfunction. New `app/core/recommenders` registry (`InterventionRecommender`).
   Stable dict contract so the engine can change without UI changes.

A trained RL model can serve **either** role (Policy for Director, or Recommender
for Recommendation / Co-Learning).

## Status

- ✅ Policy registry (heuristics today).
- ✅ Intervention recommender seam: `InterventionRecommender` + registry;
  `Phase1ProximityRecommender` is the first implementation (wraps the impact
  analysis); `/hmi/impact` resolves the active recommender.
- ✅ Impact panel UX: always visible, **auto-collapses when idle / auto-expands**
  on a malfunction; rows are **clickable** (select + highlight the train on the
  map) and **hover-highlight**; applying **Hold/Reroute dismisses** the item.
- ✅ Consistent **collapsible panels** across the right column (Impact, Strategy comparison/
  Policy, Recommendations) + KPI filter — click the header to toggle.
- ✅ Up to 3 ranked policy recommendations, **no explanation text**.
- ✅ Clear split surfaced in the UI: **Impact = per-train intervention** (local,
   malfunction) vs **Strategy comparison/Policy = system-wide strategy**.

## Planned (in order)

1. **Greedy what-if recommender** (`recommenders/greedy_whatif.py`): for each
   affected train, simulate its options (reroute / hold / proceed) with the
   ScenarioRunner, score KPI-weighted, pick best. Up to 3 ranked per situation.
2. **PP replan recommender** (`recommenders/pp_replan.py`): block the malfunction
   cell for its duration, run Prioritized Planning on the affected trains only →
   coherent multi-train reroute/hold/reorder set. First real use of our own PP
   planner ([[cbs-pp-planner-integration]]), scoped locally. CBS variant later.
   **AI4REALNET check — the version worry is largely moot (verified 2026-08-16).**
   The canonical solver source is
   [`AI4REALNET/flatland-blackbox`](https://github.com/AI4REALNET/flatland-blackbox)
   (`solvers/cbs.py`, `solvers/pp.py`). Although it declares
   `flatland-rl==4.0.3`, **the solvers import nothing from Flatland**: they run
   on a `networkx` graph plus an agent list, and every helper they use from
   `utils.py` is a pure graph/node function. Only `utils.py`'s env-setup and
   rendering half touches Flatland, and the solvers never call it. So
   [[cbs-pp-planner-integration]]'s 4.0.3-vs-4.2.6 concern is a declaration-level
   mismatch, not a code-level one, for the solver core.
   **Already done:** `flatland-blackbox`'s `pp.py`/`utils.py` are vendored into
   `backend/app/planners/blackbox/`, and the env→graph glue (`build_rail_digraph`
   in `backend/app/planners/replan.py`) is built ourselves — no consortium repo
   had a usable, licensed integration layer for it. `recommenders/pp_replan.py`
   can reuse `replan.py` directly rather than integrating anything new. Details:
   [`flatland-ecosystem-reuse-plan.md`](flatland-ecosystem-reuse-plan.md) W9.
3. **Impact panel: up to 3 ranked intervention options** + mode-aware apply
   (recommendation = highlighted + apply; co-learning = neutral / inspect;
   director = overview).
   **Same-platform precedent (checked 2026-09-06):**
   `IRT-SystemX/InteractiveAI` `main`, `backend/recommendation-service/resources/Railway/`
   (`manager.py` + `sncf_recommender.py`) already separates "candidate options
   with KPIs" from "how to present them for a mode" into four named, swappable
   functions over the same option list: `SNCF_RECO3` (best-first, one flagged
   `best`), `SNCF_risk` (all options sorted by one KPI, **no** best flag — our
   co-learning shape), `SNCF_deontic` (threshold-filter then sort — a primitive
   director-style filter), `SNCF_risk_tie_break` (primary KPI, secondary breaks
   ties). Options themselves are a static hand-authored catalog (no simulation,
   no computed KPIs) — nothing to reuse there, our real Flatland-derived
   `DecisionOption`s are already ahead of it. The transferable bit is the
   **shape**: a small `select_for_mode(options, mode, kpi_key)`-style function
   sitting after option generation, so `recommendation_generator.py` doesn't
   have to know about modes and the frontend doesn't have to re-derive
   "neutral vs ranked" from raw data. Not an AI4REALNET repo, so not a "must
   reuse" per CLAUDE.md — just a structural nudge worth stealing.
4. **Dual-path what-if visualisation (§3.3)**: on reroute, show **both** paths on
   the map/Marey — old/current (blue = human-influenced) vs new/rerouted
   (yellow = AI-simulated) — with a KPI delta. Needs the backend to compute the
   alternative route around the block (PP replan / targeted reroute path);
   today only the current path is highlighted on selection and the new forecast
   appears after applying.
4. **Clear UI separation**: intervention recommendations live in the impact panel;
   policy-change recommendations stay in the strategy-comparison panel. Label both distinctly.
5. **RL recommender** (`recommenders/rl_recommender.py`): a trained model behind
   the same seam. No UI change.
6. **Recommender selection** (settings / per session): choose the active
   recommender, like policy selection.

## RL wave (Policy seam)

- PPO agent as a `Policy` (the "real RL" goal). Train ourselves (no pretrained in
  T3.4). See rl-agents-goal memory.

Keep the data contracts stable (`Intervention` item dict / `Recommendation` list)
throughout so any engine swap is transparent to the frontend.
