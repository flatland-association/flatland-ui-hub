# Panel × Interaction-Mode Matrix

**Status:** first draft / working reference.
**Companion of:** [interaction-modes-brief.md](interaction-modes-brief.md) (authoritative
mode spec) and [mode-scoped-layouts-plan.md](../plans/mode-scoped-layouts-plan.md) (how
per-mode layouts get resolved).

This file answers two questions for every panel:

1. **Availability** — does the panel appear at all in a given mode?
2. **Behaviour** — if it appears, how does the *same* panel behave differently
   per mode?

It is grounded in the current code, not aspiration. The mode selectors that drive
this today live in `session.store.ts`:

| Selector | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `interactionMode()` | `'recommendation' \| 'co-learning' \| 'director'` — the single source of truth |
| `optionPresentation()` | `recommendation → 'recommended'`, `co-learning → 'neutral'`, `director → 'none'` |
| `aiInControl()` / `isCoLearning()` | `=== 'director'` / `=== 'co-learning'` |

Legend: **●** available · **○** not shown · **◐** available but secondary/collapsed.

## Behaviour per mode

Only panels whose behaviour actually branches on the mode are listed; the rest
render identically everywhere.

### `impact`
- **Recommendation** — surfaces the AI's recommended action; keeps the gentle
  global pause + decision countdown so the human decides *with* a suggestion.
  (`impact-panel.component.ts`)
- **Co-Learning** — affected trains shown **neutrally**; the human inspects and
  decides. Empty-state handled explicitly (`isCoLearning() && items().length === 0`).
- **Director** — **overview only**; per-decision hooks are suppressed
  (`interactionMode() !== 'director'`) because the AI handles it.

### `whatif-compare` (Widget B1 — Prediction)
- **Recommendation** — the "AI plan" column is anchored to the current course
  incl. any active suggestion; the human's proposed action is compared against
  it. **Commit** available.
- **Co-Learning** — the dual-path core (§3.3): the human formulates their own
  action ("My plan", **blue**) simulated forward against the AI plan (**yellow**),
  both neutral, no winner marked. Committing feeds the reflection module.
- **Director** — **read-only** supervisory what-if; the **Commit** button is
  hidden (the AI keeps actuation under the directive).
- Availability is **all modes** (omitted from `PANEL_MODE_AVAILABILITY` = 'all');
  only *behaviour* branches, inside `whatif-compare.component.ts`. Reuses the
  existing `POST /what-if-override` (no new backend); blue/yellow follows the
  AI4REALNET A3S/TraceRL convention. Shown in the **Co-Learning** default layout
  (right pane, under the neutral Scenario panel) as the §3.3 dual-path
  centrepiece; available in every mode via the designer palette / gallery.
  (spec: `docs/plans/widget-b1-whatif-compare.md`)

### `combined-actions` (Widget E1 — Decision Support)
- **Recommendation** — *Recommendation framing*: the AI's package is badged
  **"Recommended by AI"** and ranked first, with confidence. Reordering it adds
  **"Human modified"** and the comparison line `AI −14 min · Current −9 min`; the
  badge is kept (the AI did pick this package) but the sequence no longer reads
  as the AI's recommendation.
- **Co-Learning** — *Assessment framing*: A/B/C neutral, **no badge, no ranking**.
  The edit → re-predict loop is the point — the operator forms their own priority
  order and reads the consequence, with AI vs current always shown once modified.
- **Director** — **suppressed to read-only supervision**. Dispatch-altitude
  decision support belongs to the AI here (the human's lever is the *objective*,
  in `strategy-options`), so the executing package is marked **"AI executing"**,
  chips are not draggable and Reset/Apply are hidden.
- Availability is **all modes** (omitted from `PANEL_MODE_AVAILABILITY` = 'all');
  the mode branch lives in the component's `modeBehavior` computed.
- **Cross-view consequence (all modes).** Pointing at a card publishes
  `SessionStore.combinedActionPreview`: the **track map** marks the action's
  trains with their dispatch rank and per-train minutes, the **Marey / ZWL**
  shifts their future lines along the time axis. A priority order changes timing,
  not topology — hence the split, and hence no reroute overlay.
- ⚠ Predictions (delay *and* energy) are a deterministic **mock**
  (`dataSource: 'mock'`) — spec
  [`widget-e1-combined-actions.md`](../plans/widget-e1-combined-actions.md) §8.

### `risk-uncertainty` (Widget A1 — Trust)
- **Recommendation** — reliability shown **with** the ranked recommendation:
  `confidence` from `store.recommendations()` + a spread band derived from
  `store.scenarios()` score dispersion. Low-and-wide → amber + invites scrutiny.
- **Co-Learning** — uncertainty shown **neutrally per option** (Evaluative AI):
  each scenario gets an "evidence for / against / mixed" tag from its score
  position; no single trust-score winner.
- **Director** — **aggregate** policy reliability (mean confidence), read-only;
  a low-confidence aggregate surfaces as the **exception trigger** for
  adjustable autonomy. No accept/override instrumentation (supervisory).
- Availability is **all modes** (omitted from `PANEL_MODE_AVAILABILITY` = 'all');
  only the *behaviour* branches, inside `risk-uncertainty-panel.component.ts`.
  First cut is frontend-only and **not calibrated** — the label reads
  "model-reported confidence" until the backend UQ/calibration extension lands
  (spec §4). Not in the hardcoded default layout; available via the designer
  palette.

### `decision-log` (Widget A2 — Capitalization)
- **Recommendation** — each strip entry shows the AI suggestion alongside what
  the human chose (accept vs. override is the point).
- **Co-Learning** — entries show the human's chosen option neutrally; feeds the
  reflection prompt.
- **Director** — mostly AI auto-decisions (owner = AI); the operator's entries
  are the rarer **exception interventions** — the strip surfaces this asymmetry
  ("You stepped in N times").
- Capture is **mode-agnostic at the choke-points**: `setOverride` /
  `clearOverride` / `systemHold` log to `store.decisionLog` in all three modes
  (tagged `accountableOwner: human | ai | system`); the Co-Learning-only
  `coLearningFeedback` signal is left untouched so the reflection panel is
  unaffected. Availability is all modes (omitted from
  `PANEL_MODE_AVAILABILITY` = 'all'). Frontend read-model + localStorage
  persistence per `interaction-logging-plan.md`; backend `POST /log` mirror
  deferred. Not in the default layout; available via the designer palette.

### `scenario`
- **Recommendation** — **not shown**: `recommendations` is the policy surface in
  this mode, so `scenario` would only duplicate it.
- **Co-Learning** — the **neutral** policy-compare surface: options unranked, no
  KPI-score ordering; also the base for the §3.3 what-if compare.
- **Director** — neutral framing, **collapsed by default**: the Director
  Weights panel is the mode's directive lever and the map overlay shows the
  committed plan, so the scenario compare (baseline = the Director plan,
  alternatives = switching away) is opened on demand.

### `kpi-filter`
- **Not shown in any mode.** The Director directive lever is the
  `director-weights` panel (the goal_directed planner's dials); a second,
  unconnected weight surface in the same mode confused more than it
  steered. The `kpiPriorities` signal stays at its defaults and keeps
  feeding the scenario/recommendation scoring in every mode; only the
  slider surface is gone. Recommendation/Co-Learning rationale unchanged
  from before: weighting is "optional" there (brief §4.5), so both run on
  the defaults.

### `recommendations` / `co-learning-reflection` / `goal-achievement` / `director-directive`
Pure availability panels — each is the signature surface of exactly one mode
(see the availability table). They do not need internal mode branching.

## Design guidance (from this matrix)

- **Availability** belongs in the layout/registry layer (a declarative
  `availableModes` on the panel *type* — see the sketch below), resolved once by
  the mode-scoped-layout resolver — **not** as scattered `@if isCoLearning()` in
  `app.component.html`, which is where most of this lives today.
- **Behaviour** stays inside a **single mode-aware component** per panel (read
  `store.interactionMode()`, branch internally) — not separate registered panel
  types per mode, which would explode the designer catalogue.
- Reserve fully separate components for panels whose modes share almost nothing,
  and even then prefer a shared shell + mode-specific sub-views.

## Sketch: `availableModes` on the panel type

Availability is a property of the panel **type** (its catalogue entry), not of a
placed instance, so it belongs on `PanelDefinition`. Proposed optional,
non-breaking field:

```ts
// core/layout/models/layout.models.ts
export interface PanelDefinition {
  // …existing fields…
  /**
   * Modes in which this panel type is offered. Omitted / 'all' = every mode.
   * Consumed by the mode-scoped-layout resolver to decide availability;
   * per-mode *behaviour* is handled inside the component, not here.
   */
  availableModes?: InteractionMode[] | 'all';
}
```

Example catalogue values implied by the table above:

| `type` | `availableModes` |
|--------|------------------|
| `recommendations` | `['recommendation']` |
| `co-learning-reflection` | `['co-learning']` |
| `goal-achievement` | `['director']` |
| `director-directive` | `['director']` |
| `scenario` | `['co-learning', 'director']` |
| `kpi-filter` | `[]` (no mode) |
| `director-weights` | `['director']` |
| everything else | `'all'` |

This is a sketch: the field is declared but not yet wired into the resolver. Next
step would be to have the mode-scoped-layout resolver filter the catalogue by
`availableModes` when building a mode's default layout.
