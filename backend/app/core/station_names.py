"""Station and place names of a scene, for the operator to read.

The PF–CH scenes (Gleisschema Pfäffikon SZ–Chur) carry their geography in the
scene file: a station entry per platform track with an SBB code and a name in
ASCII ("Ziegelbruecke"), and in `metadata` the order of all places along the
line, the column each one sits at, and the single-track section. Places modelled
without tracks (Mühlehorn, Murg, …) appear there as codes only.

`STATION_NAMES` gives every code of the line its proper name; `scene_geography`
turns a scene into what the HMI needs — named platform cells, named places by
column, and the single-track section. Generated networks carry none of this and
get empty lists, so the frontend keeps its own "S1…" labels there.
