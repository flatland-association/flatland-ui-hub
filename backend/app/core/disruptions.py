"""Disruption files: scripted things that go wrong, at fixed steps.

A disruption file is the third layer of a premade setup, on top of the scene
(what the network and the missions are) and the plan (what every train is
supposed to do). It says what interferes::

    { "step": 12, "type": "train_delay", "agent_handle": 1, "delay_steps": 5 }

Deliberately separate from the scene and the plan, because the point of the
setup is to run the *same* scenario and the *same* plan against several
disruption sets — including none at all, which is the control condition.

Event types follow `docs/plans/scripted-events-plan.md` §2.1. `train_delay`
applies as a Flatland malfunction (`malfunction_down_counter`) rather than as
a new concept, so the train state machine, the delay KPI, the map badge and
the notifications all treat it exactly as they treat an emergent breakdown.

Nothing here is random: given a scene, a plan and a set of disruption files,
the whole episode is reproducible. That only holds while random malfunctions
are off, which is why the scenarios that ship a plan pin `malfunction_rate` to
zero (`setup_presets`).
