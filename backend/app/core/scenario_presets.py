"""Prebuilt scenarios that ship with the repo.

A preset is an environment committed to the repo and offered in the UI's
Infrastructure picker, so a fresh clone can select it without importing
anything. Two kinds, differing only in what the file holds:

- ``env`` — a pickled Flatland env (``RailEnvPersister.save`` format). Loading
  one reproduces a challenge instance exactly: network, traffic, train goals,
  intermediate stops, timetable and malfunctions. This is the ECML 2026 case
  from ``docs/plans/ecml2026-flatland-env.md``.
- ``scene`` — an Infrastructure-Builder scene (the same JSON the builder
  exports). It goes through the normal scene path in ``env_factory``, so the
  scene dict stays with the session and named stations survive; a pickled env
  would lose them, because ``RailEnvPersister`` does not persist ``stations``.

Presets are **non-editable by design**: selecting one must give every user the
same environment, so nothing here is copied into the builder's local storage.

A preset may pin the session settings that belong to the scenario rather than
to the user's Settings fields (``session`` below) — otherwise a scenario would
silently depend on those fields happening to be right.

A preset may also ship two further layers, both optional:

- ``plan`` — a ``*.plan.json`` giving every train's exact route and timing
  (``app.core.plans``). Selecting the scenario makes the ``plan`` policy
  available, which drives the trains along it.
- ``disturbances`` — a directory of files describing what goes wrong and when
  (``app.core.disturbances``). The user picks any subset of them at session
  start, so one scenario+plan can be run against several conditions.
