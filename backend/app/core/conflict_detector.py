"""ConflictDetectionCallbacks — passive conflict observer for Flatland.

Subclass of flatland.callbacks.callbacks.FlatlandCallbacks. Plug it into
PolicyRunner.create_from_policy(callbacks=...) or TrajectoryEvaluator
to automatically collect conflict events during a trajectory run.

Usage
-----
    detector = ConflictDetectionCallbacks(blocked_threshold=3)
    PolicyRunner.create_from_policy(
        policy=DeadLockAvoidancePolicy(),
        env=env,
        callbacks=detector,
        snapshot_interval=0,
        end_step=20,
        data_dir=tmp_dir,
    )
    conflicts = detector.get_conflicts()  # List[Conflict]
    kpis = detector.get_kpis()            # dict

Detects: blocked-streaks, swap attempts, deadlock cycles, malfunctions,
         agent_done, overdue arrivals.
