"""Schedules over the decision-point graph.

A train's whole run is a list of decision nodes it passes, each with the
number of turns it waits there:

    [node_id, wait, node_id, wait, ...]

Playing it back needs no search (`SchedulePlayer`):

- Train not on its current schedule node → drive one step closer to it
  along the edge, using the edge's stored action sequence.
- Train on the node with `wait > 0` → stand still, count the wait down.
- Train on the node with `wait == 0` → drop that entry and drive the first
  step of the edge towards the next node.

`plan_shortest_path` produces such a schedule for a single train with a
Dijkstra search over the graph, weighted by edge travel time.
