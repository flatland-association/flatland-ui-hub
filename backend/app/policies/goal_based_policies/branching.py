"""Branch generation for the Director's schedule search.

A search state is, per train, the committed *prefix* of its schedule.
This module answers the four questions the search loop asks:

- what does this prefix become if the train just drives on
  (`complete_from` — the completion policy, producing the full candidate
  the ensemble scores);
- where is the next real decision and what can be done there
  (`next_decision` — route alternatives at nodes offering more than one
  feasible way toward the next stop, crossed with the hold menu);
- what is the state after taking an option (`BranchOption.prefix`,
  already advanced through every forced node that follows, so the next
  decision is again a real one);
- is a finished candidate worth scoring at all (`has_planned_overlap` —
  plans that already collide on paper are pruned before any model call).

Decisions exist only at nodes with a genuine route choice; holding
anywhere else is out of scope for v1 (the avoidance planner shows holds
matter elsewhere too — revisit if a sweep says the action space
is too coarse).

**Completion policy: naive chained shortest path**, not Tokener's Hybrid
PP/CBS (the consortium reuse candidate). Rationale:
the completion's job here is a cheap, consistent leaf estimate, the
overlap pruner covers the "plans must not collide" part PP would
contribute, and Tokener plans on the raw Flatland grid rather than our
decision-point graph — an integration wholly out of proportion for this
role. Revisit if a sweep quantifies completion-policy bias.
