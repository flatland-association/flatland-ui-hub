"""Station extraction with their possible stop cells.

Flatland's rail *grid* carries no station concept — the grouping exists
only in the rail generator's `agents_hints`, which `RailEnv` does not
retain. Four sources, mirroring how envs are created in `env_factory`:

- **ECML presets**: the challenge ships city/platform metadata separately
  (`fixtures/ecml2026/stations.pkl`): per city its platform cells
  (`train_stations` — the possible stops) and which scenes it exists in.
- **Generator hints**: for generated networks, the same structure taken
  live from the env, retained by `StationAwareRailEnv`
  (`app.core.station_aware_env`).
- **Infrastructure-Builder scenes**: the scene dict has an explicit
  `stations` list (id, name, x, y) — one stop cell each. This never reaches
  the env, so it must be read from the scene payload.
- **Train missions** (fallback / supplement): each agent's origin and
  target, the same registry the frontend station layer derives.

`resolve_stations` combines them: the source matching the env plus mission
cells not already covered — trains must be able to stop at their own
origins and targets even when those lie outside a known station.
