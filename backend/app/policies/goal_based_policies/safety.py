"""How safe a set of schedules is — static robustness, no rollout.

`run_schedules` measures how a plan *performs*; this measures how much it
can absorb. A plan can be perfectly on time and still be a house of cards:
no slack anywhere, opposing trains threading a single-track corridor
minutes apart, the whole fleet coupled into one delay-domino line.

Four components, each a survival probability in [0, 1]:

- **slack** — can each train absorb a disruption to itself. A train's
  buffer is `latest_arrival` minus its planned arrival; fragility decays
  exponentially in that buffer. Aggregated as a product, so one
  zero-slack train caps the score no matter how comfortable the rest are.
- **deadlock** — can one delay make the plan unrecoverable. Trains cannot
  reverse, so two trains meeting head-on inside a stretch of track with
  no node between them is terminal. Every opposing pair of planned runs
  over shared cells is scored by the gap between one train clearing the
  stretch and the other entering it, discounted where rerouting exists.
- **track** — how many trains one blockage catches. Per shared cell, the
  most trains whose planned presence intersects any blockage window of
  `params.window` minutes; scored per contiguous shared stretch so a long
  corridor is one resource, not one resource per cell.
- **cascade** — how far a delay spreads. Trains are coupled wherever one
  needs a cell shortly after another clears it; a reference disruption
  of `params.delta` minutes is propagated along those couplings,
  shrinking by the follow-gap at each hop.

The composite is the product of the four — uniform on purpose, so any
single catastrophic element (a zero-slack train, a two-minute opposing
meet, a fleet-wide cascade) tanks the headline number.

Everything works on shared *cells*, never on shared graph edges: switch
wait-cells are directional, so the two directions over one physical track
run between different nodes and their edges' cell paths overlap without
ever being equal. Grouping by edge identity finds no opposing traffic at
all on real networks — measured, not hypothetical.

Everything reads the *planned* timeline (`edge_time_windows`), never a
rollout: the score is exposure under naive replay. The reactive layer
(deadlock-avoidance policy, `SchedulePlayer` holding at blocked cells)
may catch some of these at runtime — a plan that depends on that safety
net is exactly what should score as unsafe. Parameter defaults are
hand-picked; calibrating them against malfunction rollouts is the
follow-up step, which is why they all sit in one `SafetyParams`.
