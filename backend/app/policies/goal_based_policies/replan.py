"""Mid-episode re-planning for the Director.

The residual problem is deliberately expressed in the language the value
models already speak: a full-horizon schedule from each train's origin,
in which everything up to the train's current position is *pinned* and
reality's delay is folded into a virtual wait at the train's frontier
node. State-conditioning happens through the existing encoding — pinned
prefixes and waits are ordinary schedule features the models were
trained on — so the installed checkpoints stay valid and no re-training
or new input scheme is needed. The trade-offs of that choice:

- Past occupancies keep their *nominal* times, not their actual ones.
  Harmless for the future (past windows cannot conflict with future
  ones), but the overlap pruner may see phantom overlaps between two
  pinned pasts; the search's clean-preference already degrades softly to
  score-only in that case.
- The models rank residual plans optimistically, so recovery re-plans
  are committed on simulated outcomes, not scores — see `rollout_gate`
  for the measured rationale.

Capture (`capture_progress`) reads the live `SchedulePlayer`: per train,
the entries already consumed, where it stands on the current edge, the
wait already served, and the remaining malfunction time. From that it
builds, per train:

- a *seed prefix* the search continues from — executed nodes plus the
  frontier node, whose wait is set so that the nominal departure time
  from the frontier equals the earliest the train can actually leave;
- the *continue candidate* — seed plus the rest of the committed plan —
  the do-nothing baseline every re-plan must beat;
- the splice bookkeeping (`pin_wait`, `serve_base`, `tail_anchor`) that
  turns a chosen absolute schedule back into player entries: the player
  serves `serve_base` (dwell still owed, malfunction remaining) plus
  whatever extra hold the search added on top of the pin.

`residual_plan` runs the ordinary search strategies from those seeds
(`seeds=` parameter) and holds the result against the continue
candidate under the same weighted score — mid-episode, ties keep the
current plan: churn needs to pay for itself.

What-if / simulate-forward: `simulate_forward` drives a forked env from
its current state to the episode end under a player and reports absolute
outcomes. Together with `capture_progress`/`residual_plan` on the fork
this is the A3S restore → simulate-forward → report contract
(`agent-as-a-service-trace-rl`) implemented in-process — an explicit
decision: the consortium service needs Redis plus
its own processes, while this repo's verify endpoint already forks envs;
the seam (fork, re-plan, roll forward, report) is kept narrow so the
service can replace it.
