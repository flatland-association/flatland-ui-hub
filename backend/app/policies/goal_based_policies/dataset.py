"""Training data for the schedule evaluator.

Samples are `(schedules) -> (all trains arrived, delay bucket)`, labelled by
actually running the schedules in Flatland.

The observation is the decision-point graph **plus** the schedules on it:

- the graph as node features and an edge list carrying travel times, so the
  model can see what the network actually looks like;
- each train's schedule as the sequence of graph nodes it visits (as local
  indices into that graph) and the wait taken at each;
- each train's timetable and how its plan sits inside it (earliest
  departure, deadline, planned duration, slack, total hold).

Giving the graph itself is what makes varying infrastructure workable: node
meaning is *computed* from structure rather than looked up in a global
embedding table, so the same model applies to a network it has never seen,
and nothing depends on ids meaning the same thing across layouts.

By default **every scenario gets its own freshly generated network**, so no
layout is ever seen twice. That makes memorising a particular network
impossible and turns any held-out split into a direct measure of transfer.
Pass an explicit `layouts` pool to go back to reusing a fixed set.

Which networks and scenarios get drawn is a `ScenarioMix`. `TRAINING_MIX`
is the default and is what the shipped models were fitted on; `EVAL_MIXES`
are held-out distributions that push one knob each past where training went,
drawing their layout seeds from a range training never touched so an eval
set provably shares no infrastructure with it (see `eval_set`).

Networks vary in grid size and city count, scenarios in their number of
trains, and schedules come from three sources:

- shortest path per train, conflict-blind (the naive plan),
- shortest path plus the holds the repo's `DeadLockAvoidancePolicy` takes
  when it runs the same scenario (reactive overlap avoidance),
- prioritised planning with cell reservations (`plan_avoiding_overlaps`),
- any of those with random holds layered on.

Measured on this generator, none of the three dominates: the reactive
policy gets ~90% of trains home but freezing its stops into fixed holds
loses that advantage, and reservation planning trims mean delay while
costing arrivals, because a hold can only sit on a decision node — which is
on the running line and therefore blocks the trains behind it. The mix is
there to give the evaluator different *styles* of plan to tell apart, not
because one of them is the good one.

    Building a Flatland env is expensive in memory in a way that does not

    rather than memory the OS can reuse. Measured at ~5 MB retained per
    scenario, so a 36k-scenario dataset would need well over 100 GB in one
    process — it drove this machine into swap at 12k.

    A process that exits returns everything, so each chunk runs in a worker
    that is recycled afterwards (`maxtasksperchild=1`). Only the encoded
    samples — ~19 KB each — cross back to the parent. Generation is
    CPU-bound and independent per scenario, so this also parallelises it.

    Deterministic, but *not* the same stream as `generate_samples(count,
    seed)`: chunk *i* runs its own generator seeded from `seed`, so the same
    arguments give the same dataset while different chunking does not.
