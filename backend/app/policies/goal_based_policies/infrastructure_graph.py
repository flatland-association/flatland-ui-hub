"""Reduced infrastructure graph containing only decision points.

Takes the setup a policy faces when solving a run in the UI — a Flatland
``RailEnv`` (as handed to ``Policy.reset(env)``) — and compresses its rail
grid into a graph with two node kinds:

- **station**: a cell where a train can stop for traffic reasons. Derived
  from the trains' origins and targets, mirroring the frontend station
  registry (SessionStore.stations()).
- **switch_decision**: the wait cells in front of a switch. A simple switch
  funnels two tracks into a third; a train coming along one of the two
  funneled tracks can stop on the tile *before* the switch and let a train
  using the other branch pass. Each switch therefore contributes one
  decision cell per funneled (trailing) approach — two for a simple switch.

Edges connect nodes a train can reach by driving normally along the track
without passing any other node *relevant for its direction of travel*.
Switch wait cells are directional — they point at their switch and only
concern trains heading into it; a train rolling over one in any other
direction (e.g. leaving the switch over the far branch) passes it without a
decision, so walks skip it. Station stops are relevant in every direction.
Edges are directed and carry the full cell path plus entry/exit headings.
