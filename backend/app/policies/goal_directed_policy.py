"""The Director planner as a session policy.

Plans every train once per env with the weighted model-guided search
(`director_plan`), then drives the plan with `SchedulePlayer`. The three
weights — punctuality, connections, stability — are the Director-mode
dials; scoring happens at plan time, so changing them takes effect on the
next planned env, no retraining involved.

Mid-episode the plan is not fixed: a malfunction of consequence — or a
weight change while trains are already on the map — triggers a *residual*
re-plan (`replan.py`) from the captured current state, spliced into the
live player only when it out-scores continuing the committed plan. Every
re-plan is recorded in the plan info under `"replans"`.

Session APIs rebuild the Policy object on every request, so nothing
useful can live on the instance: the plan, the player's progress and the
plan's provenance are cached per *env* (weak-keyed — a dropped env takes
its plan with it). `reset(env)` plans only when the env has no plan yet.

torch is imported lazily and only when checkpoints are actually found
(`GOAL_DIRECTED_EVALUATOR` / `GOAL_DIRECTED_CONNECTION_MODEL`, defaulting
to `backend/models/goal_directed/`). Without models the policy still
works: it falls back to `plan_avoiding_overlaps`, recorded as such in the
plan info — degraded, never broken. A train the planner could not route
holds (DO_NOTHING) rather than guessing.
