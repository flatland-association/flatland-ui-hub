"""PlanPolicy — drive trains along a premade plan (`app.core.plans`).

Replay is **by position, never by clock.** The obvious implementation ("at
step t, do whatever the plan lists for step t") holds only while nothing goes
wrong: the first disturbance puts a train five steps behind, the plan pointer
runs on without it, and every action after that belongs to a cell the train is
not in. Instead each step reads the train's actual `(position, direction)` out
of the env, finds it in its own trainrun, and emits the action that moves it to
the next waypoint. A delayed train therefore keeps its planned *route* and
carries its delay forward, which is the whole reason to run a plan against a
disturbance file rather than replaying a recording.

`SchedulePlayer` in `goal_based_policies/schedule.py` resolves the same problem
the same way, over decision-graph nodes instead of cells.

Positions alone are not enough either, because a plan encodes *two* things and
only one of them is written down. "Wait at WN until step 40" is really "wait
until W1 has come through the single-track section"; once a disturbance pushes
everything past step 40, the written form is satisfied and the meant form is
not — the waiting trains drive into the section and meet W1 head-on. So replay
enforces the plan's **order at every cell** as well as its times: a train may
enter a cell only once every train the plan puts there before it has been
through. Times still gate the undisturbed case exactly; the order is what
survives a delay. This is the standard re-scheduling result — keeping the
planned order at each resource keeps a feasible plan feasible when times slip.

One consequence shapes the whole implementation: **the policy may not remember
anything between steps.** `api/sessions.py` builds a fresh policy on every
`/step` request, so per-instance progress is wiped several times per episode.
Anything the order rule needs is therefore derived from the env each step —
"has that train been through this cell yet?" is answered by locating it in its
own trainrun, not by a set the policy accumulated. The one thing that cannot be
derived, which train has left its plan, is stashed on the env next to the plan
itself.

Two trains are not on the plan:

- one the plan does not mention at all;
- one that has left its plan — in practice because the operator overrode it.

Both fall to `fallback` (the app default, deadlock avoidance) and, once off,
stay off for the rest of the episode. Silently snapping an overridden train
back onto the plan would hide the consequence of the operator's decision,
which in this app is the thing under study.
