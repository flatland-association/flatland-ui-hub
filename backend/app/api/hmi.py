    `horizonSteps` is the compute budget the forecast ran with — how far
    `run_branch` looked ahead. It is *not* a reliability statement (the
    strategy-forecast panel's load-shrinking `horizonMinutes` is that); the two
    are deliberately different things (spec §8). The frontend renders it in
    minutes via the shared `MINUTES_PER_STEP` convention so the panel says how
    far ahead it looked in the operator's unit. All times at this boundary are
    in simulation steps; the frontend converts. Train names stay frontend —
    handles are returned as `agentHandle`, never a service name.

    Empty groups — not an error — when the network has no contentions ahead,
    and on any forecast failure (a forecast must never break the panel).
    `horizonSteps` is returned even then, so the panel can state its lookahead
    regardless of whether this step found a contention. Memoised per
    (session_id, current_step) so repeated polls within one step are free.
