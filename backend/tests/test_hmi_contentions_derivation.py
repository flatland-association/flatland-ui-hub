"""Tests for the additive per-handle enrichment of GET /hmi/contentions.

Task 1 derives four quantities — baselineOrder, headway, entryDelay, slack —
all from the one forecast `result` the endpoint already produces (no second
run_branch). Task 2 carries them on the existing payload additively
(`handles` unchanged). These tests pin both:

  * the four quantities are derived on pf-ch-corridor-stops (the only preset
    where trains carry intermediate stops, against which slack is measurable);
  * a quantity not derivable in the horizon is null + unavailable_reason,
    never a silent zero;
  * `handles` is unchanged so the existing variant keeps working;
  * `location` is a station name where the window overlaps one, else the cell
    — never invented;
  * entryDelay matches the serializer.py formula (agent_outcomes is the
    source, not a re-derivation);
  * train names stay frontend — handles are returned as `agentHandle`.

The derivation helpers are also driven directly with synthetic inputs, so the
window/location/null-path contracts are pinned deterministically rather than
seed-waiting for a station to fall inside a contention window.
