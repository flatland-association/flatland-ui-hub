"""End-to-end tests for GET /{session_id}/hmi/contentions.

The endpoint is the backend half of widget E1's "packages from live
conflicts": it runs a no-override forecast branch and returns the
multi-agent contentions ahead, grouped, most-urgent first, plus the
forecast budget (`horizonSteps`) the panel states on screen. These tests
pin the contract the Combined Actions panel depends on:

  * a session with a real contention returns one group whose handles are all
    real session handles (the defect fix — no phantoms);
  * a conflict-free session returns empty groups (never an error, never a
    synthesised package to fill the panel) — and still states its horizon;
  * single-train kinds are filtered out;
  * multiple events for the same contention collapse into one group;
  * a forecast failure stays empty and never raises;
  * the horizon budget is always present, so the panel can state its lookahead
    regardless of whether this step found a contention;
  * 404 for an unknown session.
