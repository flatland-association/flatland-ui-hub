/**
 * Mode presentation adapter for the Widget Gallery — the seam for the planned
 * two-axis split.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * `InteractionMode` currently carries two independent things at once:
 *
 *   A. **Autonomy level** — who owns Monitoring / Generating / Selecting /
 *      Implementing (Timpe & Kolrep 2002; Parasuraman, Sheridan & Wickens 2000).
 *   B. **Collaboration goal** — what the interaction is *for*: get this decision
 *      right now, or learn about each other (calibrated trust).
 *
 * On axis A, `recommendation` and `co-learning` barely differ — both leave
 * Selecting with the human and Implementing with the system (level 5 in the
 * Timpe/Weyer taxonomy). Their real difference — neutral options, reflection,
 * what-if compare — is axis B, carried on the wrong axis. Conversely
 * "supervised **and** co-learning" cannot be expressed today at all, although a
 * supervisor override in Director is a *stronger* learning signal than a click
 * in Recommendation.
 *
 * The intended resolution keeps `InteractionMode` as a **named preset** over the
 * two axes rather than as the primitive (so the CLAUDE.md guardrail holds — no
 * parallel flag). Experiments consume the presets (fixed, comparable
 * conditions); a prototype consumes the axes (free movement = adjustable
 * autonomy). See `docs/reference/interaction-framework.md` §3, which already
 * models `allocation` as its own concept for exactly this reason.
 *
 * ## What this file does today
 *
 * Nothing semantic. `MODE_SETUPS` documents the mapping; `modeRowsFor()` is the
 * single place the gallery asks "how does this widget behave per mode". When the
 * split lands, this function changes and the gallery's template does not.
