/**
 * Decision Log (Tile A2) — the session's owned, timestamped decision record.
 *
 * Spec: docs/plans/tile-a2-decision-log.md. `kind` = Capitalization. This is
 * the first visible slice of [interaction-logging-plan.md](../plans/interaction-logging-plan.md)
 * — it reuses existing capture choke-points (setOverride / clearOverride /
 * systemHold) rather than introducing a parallel logging mechanism.
 *
 * Every entry has an `accountableOwner`:
 *   - 'human'  — the operator clicked (accept or override; either way a human
 *                decision, per the spec's §6 acceptance scenario)
 *   - 'ai'     — the AI auto-applied (countdown expiry / autonomous Director)
 *   - 'system' — a safe-default hold (`SessionStore.systemHold`), deliberately
 *                NOT attributed to either party (the code's own comment at
 *                session.store.ts:981)
 *
 * The schema field names map cleanly onto the WP4 Railway KPI catalog
 * (override rate → KPI-HS-003; decisionTimeMs → KPI-HS-023; accept/override
 * ratio → KPI-AS-005) — see the spec's §5b. No FAB/orchestrator integration is
 * done here; this is purely a naming precaution.

 * answer "did they take the AI's answer or their own?", which is the question
 * (Q3, accountability) the log exists for. `action` says which: `'accept'` when
