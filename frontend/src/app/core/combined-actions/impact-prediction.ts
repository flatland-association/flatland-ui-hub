 * Spec: docs/plans/widget-e1-combined-actions.md §8.
 *
 * This is a placeholder for a real re-solve of a human-supplied train priority
 * order. The consortium reuse target is the CBS/PP solver in
 * `AI4REALNET/flatland-blackbox`: running PP with the operator's priority order is
 * exactly the computation this file fakes. Building it from scratch here is a
 * deliberate, spec'd decision — the first cut is about the *interaction* (human
 * edits a coordinated multi-train action → system re-evaluates the consequence),
 * not the optimiser.
 *
 * The only contract that matters for the swap: `predictImpact` is pure and
 * total — the same order ALWAYS yields the same numbers. A prediction that
 * jitters between identical inputs is not something an operator can calibrate
 * trust against (core question Q2).
