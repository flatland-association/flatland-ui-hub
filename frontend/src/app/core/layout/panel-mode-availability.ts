 * present here is available in every mode ('all'). This is the availability the
 * future mode-scoped-layout resolver will read; until it exists, the hardcoded
 * default layout (AppComponent) consults it directly instead of scattering
 * `@if (store.isCoLearning())` / `aiInControl()` checks across the template.
 *
 * Behaviour per mode stays inside the panel components (read
 * `store.interactionMode()`); this map is availability only.
