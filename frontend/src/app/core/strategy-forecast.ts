/**
 * Strategy Impact Forecast — "what will this option do over the next half hour?"
 *
 * Ported from the Director-Mode Reflection Playground prototype: three rows
 * (the conflict itself, the primary goal, the side effect) across four columns
 * (Now / +10 / +20 / +30 min), each cell a coloured state chip.
 *
 * Two honest limits, deliberately visible in the UI:
 *  - It is a **rule-based projection** from the option's KPI deltas, not a
 *    re-simulation of the next 30 minutes.
 *  - Its **reliable horizon shrinks with system load**: with several problems
 *    open at once the far columns turn 'unknown' instead of pretending to know.
 *    Stabilising decisions widen the horizon again — the coupling that makes
 *    "the future gets murkier the more I let pile up" visible.
