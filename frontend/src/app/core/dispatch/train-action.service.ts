/**
 * TrainActionService — the single authority for acting on one train.
 *
 * Why a service and not just `SessionStore.setOverride`: every widget injects
 * the store to *read*, so a store method makes the read/write boundary
 * invisible. Acting requires injecting this service, which turns "may this
 * widget change anything?" into a visible import — checkable by eye and by
 * grep, and declared per widget as `writes` in `core/widgets/widget-catalog.ts`.
 *
 * It also removes a real duplication: before this, the toggle handler
 * (`isOverride ? clear : set`) was copied into five components — the Marey
 * chart's own comment said "mirrors left-sidebar.onActionClick". Five copies of
 * a decision rule is five places for it to drift.
 *
 * This service does not re-implement the write. `SessionStore` stays the single
 * implementation (optimistic update → decision log → rationale prompt → API);
 * the service is the doorway to it, and the thing that stamps the origin.
