 *
 * - **connections** is the geometric mean of the per-transfer keep
 *   probabilities, clamped at 1e-4. Over 35 transfers a handful of hopeless ones
 *   pull it to ~2 % while 38 % of transfers actually hold. Correct as the
 *   search's veto signal, wrong on a card — so the plain kept share is shown,
 *   which the backend explicitly calls "the number to report".
 * - **stability** is `slack × deadlock × track × cascade`. Measured example:
 *   0.69 × 0.007 × 0.72 × 0.50 = 0.0017, i.e. "0 %" — while three of the four
 *   reserves are fine and only the deadlock risk is critical. The product is
